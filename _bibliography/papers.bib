  abstract={Converting CO2 to synthetic hydrocarbon fuels is of increasing interest. In light of progress in electrified CO2 to ethylene, we explored routes to dimerize to 1-butene, an olefin that can serve as a building block to ethylene longer-chain alkanes. With goal of selective and active dimerization, we investigate a series of metal–organic frameworks having bimetallic catalytic sites. We find that the tunable pore structure enables optimization of selectivity and that periodic pore channels enhance activity. In a tandem system for the conversion of CO2 to 1-C4H8, wherein the outlet cathodic gas from a CO2-to-C2H4 electrolyzer is fed directly (via a dehumidification stage) into the C2H4 dimerizer, we study the highest-performing MOF found herein: M′ = Ru and M″ = Ni in the bimetallic two-dimensional M′2(OAc)4M″(CN)4 MOF. We report a 1-C4H8 production rate of 1.3 mol gcat–1 h–1 and a C2H4 conversion of 97%. From these experimental data, we project an estimated cradle-to-gate carbon intensity of −2.1 kg-CO2e/kg-1-C4H8 when CO2 is supplied from direct air capture and when the required energy is supplied by electricity having the carbon intensity of wind.},

  abstract={It is of interest to extend the reach of CO2 and CO electrochemistry to the synthesis of products with molecular weights higher than the C1 and C2 seen in most prior reports carried out near ambient conditions. Here we present a cascade C1–C2–C4 system that combines electrochemical and thermochemical reactors to produce C4H10 selectively at ambient conditions. In a C2H4 dimerization reactor, we directly upgrade the gas outlet stream of the CO2 or CO electrolyser without purification. We find that CO, which is present alongside C2H4, enhances C2H4 dimerization selectivity to give C4H10 to 95%, a much higher performance than when a CO2 electrolyser is used instead. We achieve an overall two-stage CO-to-C4H10 cascade selectivity of 43%. Mechanistic investigations, complemented by density functional theory calculations reveal that increased CO coverage favours C2H4 dimerization and hydrogenation of *CxHy adsorbates, as well as destabilizes the *C4H9 intermediate, and so promotes the selective production of the target alkane.},

The acidic environment hinders water electrolysis on non-noble catalysts, a result of the sluggish kinetics associated with the adsorbate evolution mechanism, reliant as it is on four concerted proton-electron transfer steps. Enabling a faster mechanism with non-noble catalysts will help to further advance acidic water electrolysis. Here, we report evidence that doping Ba cations into a Co3O4 framework to form Co3–xBaxO4 promotes the oxide path mechanism and simultaneously improves activity in acidic electrolytes. Co3–xBaxO4 catalysts reported herein exhibit an overpotential of 278 mV at 10 mA/cm2 in 0.5 M H2SO4 electrolyte and are stable over 110 h of continuous water oxidation operation. We find that the incorporation of Ba cations shortens the Co–Co distance and promotes OH adsorption, findings we link to improved water oxidation in acidic electrolyte.},

  abstract={Electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) to high-value product, CO, not only provides a key feedstock for the well-established Fischer—Tropsch process but also mitigates the greenhouse effect. However, it suffers from sluggish reaction kinetics, competitive hydrogen evolution reaction, and low selectivity. Herein, we report non-precious Cu-Sn diatomic sites anchored on nitrogen-doped porous carbon (CuSn/NPC) as an efficient catalyst for CO2RR to CO. The catalyst exhibits outstanding selectivity with CO Faradaic efficiency (FE) up to 99.1%, much higher than those of individual Cu (66.2%) and Sn (51.3%) single-atom catalysts. Moreover, high stability is confirmed by consecutive 24 h electrolysis with high selectivity from CO2 to CO. Theoretical calculations reveal an obvious activation of CO2 with weakened C—O bonds and distorted CO2 configuration upon chemisorption on the CuSn/NPC catalyst. It is also suggested CuSn/NPC is more selective for the CO2RR with dominant CO production during the electrolysis, rather than the competing hydrogen evolution reaction.},

  abstract={Two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides (2D TMDCs) show promise as potential inexpensive electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). However, their performance is bottlenecked by the inertness of the basal plane. The present study demonstrates alloying as a viable route to address such limitations. A machine learning workflow based on density functional theory (DFT) calculations has been established to predict the HER activity and stability for a series of 2D cation-mixed TMDC alloys of various compositions. The results showed that alloying exhibits a substantial effect in reducing the Gibbs free energy of hydrogen adsorption (ΔGH) on the basal plane, able to render optimal ΔGH for the HER for certain TMDC alloys. The stability prediction of these TMDC alloys further showed their potential to be synthesized in experiments. The mechanism underlying this alloying induced basal plane activation originates from the electronic effect, in particular the p-band shifting, resulting from the chemical composition variation. The findings are expected to serve as guidance for the rational design and discovery of TMDC alloys for catalytic applications.},

  abstract={Performing CO2 reduction in acidic conditions enables high single-pass CO2 conversion efficiency. However, a faster kinetics of the hydrogen evolution reaction compared to CO2 reduction limits the selectivity toward multicarbon products. Prior studies have shown that adsorbed hydroxide on the Cu surface promotes CO2 reduction in neutral and alkaline conditions. We posited that limited adsorbed hydroxide species in acidic CO2 reduction could contribute to a low selectivity to multicarbon products. Here we report an electrodeposited Cu catalyst that suppresses hydrogen formation and promotes selective CO2 reduction in acidic conditions. Using in situ time-resolved Raman spectroscopy, we show that a high concentration of CO and OH on the catalyst surface promotes C-C coupling, a finding that we correlate with evidence of increased CO residence time. The optimized electrodeposited Cu catalyst achieves a 60% faradaic efficiency for ethylene and 90% for multicarbon products. When deployed in a slim flow cell, the catalyst attains a 20% energy efficiency to ethylene, and 30% to multicarbon products.},

  abstract={The carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide electroreduction reactions, when powered using low-carbon electricity, offer pathways to the decarbonization of chemical manufacture1,2. Copper (Cu) is relied on today for carbon–carbon coupling, in which it produces mixtures of more than ten C2+ chemicals3,4,5,6: a long-standing challenge lies in achieving selectivity to a single principal C2+ product7,8,9. Acetate is one such C2 compound on the path to the large but fossil-derived acetic acid market. Here we pursued dispersing a low concentration of Cu atoms in a host metal to favour the stabilization of ketenes10—chemical intermediates that are bound in monodentate fashion to the electrocatalyst. We synthesize Cu-in-Ag dilute (about 1 atomic per cent of Cu) alloy materials that we find to be highly selective for acetate electrosynthesis from CO at high *CO coverage, implemented at 10 atm pressure. Operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy indicates in situ-generated Cu clusters consisting of <4 atoms as active sites. We report a 12:1 ratio, an order of magnitude increase compared to the best previous reports, in the selectivity for acetate relative to all other products observed from the carbon monoxide electroreduction reaction. Combining catalyst design and reactor engineering, we achieve a CO-to-acetate Faradaic efficiency of 91% and report a Faradaic efficiency of 85% with an 820-h operating time. High selectivity benefits energy efficiency and downstream separation across all carbon-based electrochemical transformations, highlighting the importance of maximizing the Faradaic efficiency towards a single C2+ product11.},

Here we pursue CH4-selective electrocatalysis in acidic conditions via a coordination method, stabilizing free Cu ions by bonding Cu with multidentate donor sites. We find that hexadentate donor sites in ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid enable the chelation of Cu ions, regulating Cu cluster size and forming Cu-N/O single sites that achieve high CH4 selectivity in acidic conditions. We report a CH4 Faradaic efficiency of 71% (at 100 mA cm−2) with <3% loss in total input CO2 that results in an overall energy intensity (254 GJ/tonne CH4), half that of existing electroproduction routes.},

  abstract={Acidic electrochemical CO2 reduction (CO2R) addresses CO2 loss and thus mitigates the energy penalties associated with CO2 recovery; however, acidic CO2R suffers low selectivity. One promising remedy—using a high concentration of alkali cations—steers CO2R towards multi-carbon (C2+) products, but these same alkali cations result in salt formation, limiting operating stability to <15 h. Here we present a copper catalyst functionalized with cationic groups (CG) that enables efficient CO2 activation in a stable manner. By replacing alkali cations with immobilized benzimidazolium CG within ionomer coatings, we achieve over 150 h of stable CO2R in acid. We find the water-management property of CG minimizes proton migration that enables operation at a modest voltage of 3.3 V with mildly alkaline local pH, leading to more energy-efficient CO2R with a C2+ Faradaic efficiency of 80 ± 3%. As a result, we report an energy efficiency of 28% for acidic CO2R towards C2+ products and a single-pass CO2 conversion efficiency exceeding 70%.},

  abstract={Industrial water splitting pairs cathodic hydrogen evolution with oxygen evolution at the anode, the latter generating low-value oxygen as the oxidative product. We reasoned that replacing the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with anodic electrosynthesis of acetic acid from ethanol at industrial current densities could be a route to increase the economic efficiency of green hydrogen production. We partition the selective oxidation of ethanol to acetic acid into two mechanistically distinct transformations: first ethanol oxidation followed by the production of *OH. Density functional theory (DFT) studies show that the aldehyde-derived intermediate CH3CO* from ethanol oxidation and the *OH radical from water dissociation are both needed in the electroproduction of acetic acid. Operando Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy identifies the corresponding aldehyde intermediates on the anode surface. Based on these mechanistic findings, we develop a vacancy-rich IrRuOx catalyst and achieve selective electrotransformation of ethanol to acetic acid at a generation rate of 30 mmol/cm2/h and a partial current density of 3 A/cm2, fully 10× higher than in the previous highest-activity reports.},

We report a strategy that increases selectivity to urea using a hybrid catalyst: two classes of site independently stabilize the key intermediates needed in urea formation, *CO2NO2 and *COOHNH2, via a relay catalysis mechanism. A Faradaic efficiency of 75% at wastewater-level nitrate concentrations (1,000 ppm NO3− [N]) is achieved on Zn/Cu catalysts. The resultant catalysts show a urea production rate of 16 µmol h−1 cm−2.

Central to the construction of a rational artificial photosynthesis integrated device is the requirement for a catalyst to break the bottleneck of C–C coupling. Here, based on operando spectroscopy measurements, theoretical calculations and feedstock experiments, it is discovered that gold, in conjunction with iridium, can catalyse the reduction of CO2, achieving C–C coupling by insertion of CO2 into –CH3. Due to a combination of optoelectronic and catalytic properties, the assembly of AuIr with InGaN nanowires on silicon enables the achievement of a C2H6 activity of 58.8 mmol g−1 h−1 with a turnover number of 54,595 over 60 h.

However, pristine TMDCs are bottlenecked by the insufficiency of active sites in the basal plane. In this study, focusing on polycrystalline MoS2, we perform systematic density functional theory calculations to investigate the role of grain boundaries (GBs) on the catalytic performance of MoS2 for CO2RR. Our results show that most GBs contribute to lowering the reaction energy of the potential-limiting step in CO2RR. This effect can be further amplified with the introduction of S vacancies. In addition, the introduction of GBs with vacancies is shown to act as an effective method to break the scaling relations between reaction intermediates, which is crucial in improving catalytic efficiencies. Our findings demonstrate that defect engineering holds great potential to activate the basal plane of TMDCs for CO2RR, providing valuable insights into engineering TMDCs for high-performing CO2RR electrocatalysts.},

Single-atom catalysts with maximized metal utilization and altered electronic structure are the most promising alternatives to replace current benchmark precious metals. However, the atomic level understanding of the functional role for each species at the anchoring sites is still unclear and poorly elucidated. Herein, we report Fe single atom catalysts with the sulfur and oxygen functional groups near the atomically dispersed metal centers (Fe1/NSOC) for highly efficient ORR. The Fe1/NSOC delivers a half-wave potential of 0.92 V vs. RHE, which is much better than those of commercial Pt/C (0.88 V), Fe single atoms on N-doped carbon (Fe1/NC, 0.89 V) and most reported nonprecious metal catalysts.

The density functional theory calculations demonstrate the existence of sulfur and epoxy group engineer the charges of Fe reactive center and facilitate the reductive release of OH* (rate-limiting step), thus boosting the overall oxygen reduction efficiency.},

Theoretical calculations elucidate that the exposed (110) facet over PdCu3/NC is the active center for CO2 activation and rapid formation of the key *COOH intermediate.},

  abstract={Cement production is a carbon-intensive industrial process, with the sector contributing ∼8% of global anthropogenic CO2 emissions. On average, producing each kilogram of cement leads to the emission of 1 kg of CO2─the combination of fuel combustion emissions and carbon released from the feedstock, limestone (CaCO3). Here we report electrochemical cement production based on anion-mediated electrochemical calcium extraction (ECE) that addresses both feedstock and energy emissions. The in situ-generated acidic electrolytes release the feedstock CO2 emissions at high purity, enabling direct carbon utilization or sequestration without costly capture and purification steps. Energy embodied within a separate H2 output stream is sufficient to sinter Ca(OH)2 to produce portland cement, thus removing the CO2 emissions associated with fuel combustion. We then replace CaCO3 with a carbon-free calcium feedstock, gypsum, thereby removing the CO2 emissions embodied in the feedstock. Technoeconomic analysis forecasts that this method could provide a viable, decarbonized cement alternative.},

  abstract={Potential applications of III-nitrides have led to their monolayer allotropes, i.e., two-dimensional (2D) III-nitrides, having attracted much attention. Recently, alloying has been demonstrated as an effective method to control the properties of 2D materials. In this study, the stability, and the electronic and chemical properties of monolayer Ga(1−x)AlxN alloys were investigated employing density functional theory (DFT) calculations and the cluster expansion (CE) method. The results show that 2D Ga(1−x)AlxN alloys are thermodynamically stable and complete miscibility in the alloys can be achieved at ambient temperature (>85 K). By analyzing CE results, the atomic arrangement of 2D Ga(1−x)AlxN was revealed, showing that Ga/Al atoms tend to mix with the Al/Ga atoms in their next nearest site. The band gaps of Ga(1−x)AlxN random alloys can be tuned by varying the chemical composition, and the corresponding bowing parameter was calculated as −0.17 eV. Biaxial tensile strain was also found to change the band gap values of Ga(1−x)AlxN random alloys ascribed to its modifications to the CBM positions. The chemical properties of Ga(1−x)AlxN can also be significantly altered by strain, making them good candidates as photocatalysts for water splitting. The present study can play a crucial role in designing and optimizing 2D III-nitrides for next-generation electronics and photocatalysis.},

  abstract={The electrochemical reduction of CO2 in acidic conditions enables high single-pass carbon efficiency. However, the competing hydrogen evolution reaction reduces selectivity in the electrochemical reduction of CO2, a reaction in which the formation of CO, and its ensuing coupling, are each essential to achieving multicarbon (C2+) product formation. These two reactions rely on distinct catalyst properties that are difficult to achieve in a single catalyst. Here we report decoupling the CO2-to-C2+ reaction into two steps, CO2-to-CO and CO-to-C2+, by deploying two distinct catalyst layers operating in tandem to achieve the desired transformation. The first catalyst, atomically dispersed cobalt phthalocyanine, reduces CO2 to CO with high selectivity. This process increases local CO availability to enhance the C–C coupling step implemented on the second catalyst layer, which is a Cu nanocatalyst with a Cu–ionomer interface. The optimized tandem electrodes achieve 61% C2H4 Faradaic efficiency and 82% C2+ Faradaic efficiency at 800 mA cm−2 at 25 °C. When optimized for single-pass utilization, the system reaches a single-pass carbon efficiency of 90 ± 3%, simultaneous with 55 ± 3% C2H4 Faradaic efficiency and a total C2+ Faradaic efficiency of 76 ± 2%, at 800 mA cm−2 with a CO2 flow rate of 2 ml min−1.},

  abstract={Electrosynthesis of acetate from CO offers the prospect of a low-carbon-intensity route to this valuable chemical––but only once sufficient selectivity, reaction rate and stability are realized. It is a high priority to achieve the protonation of the relevant intermediates in a controlled fashion, and to achieve this while suppressing the competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and while steering multicarbon (C2+) products to a single valuable product––an example of which is acetate. Here we report interface engineering to achieve solid/liquid/gas triple-phase interface regulation, and we find that it leads to site-selective protonation of intermediates and the preferential stabilization of the ketene intermediates: this, we find, leads to improved selectivity and energy efficiency toward acetate. Once we further tune the catalyst composition and also optimize for interfacial water management, we achieve a cadmium-copper catalyst that shows an acetate Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 75% with ultralow HER (<0.2% H2 FE) at 150 mA cm−2. We develop a high-pressure membrane electrode assembly system to increase CO coverage by controlling gas reactant distribution and achieve 86% acetate FE simultaneous with an acetate full-cell energy efficiency (EE) of 32%, the highest energy efficiency reported in direct acetate electrosynthesis.},

  abstract={The discovery of metal-nitrogen centers as the active sites for electrolysis has aroused significant interest in utilizing single-atom catalysts for nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR). Properly designed nanostructured catalysts that strongly interact with nitrogen molecules (N2) can promote adsorption and activation, thereby resulting in efficient catalysts with high stability, activity, and selectivity. In this study, using density functional theory calculations, we selected monolayer black phosphorus (BP) as the substrate and screened a series of single-atom transition metals confined in tri-coordinated and tetra-coordinated active centers (without and with N dopants) to electro-catalyze NRR. As a result, we have identified two promising candidates (Hf1-N1P2-1 and Tc1-N4), which exhibit not only low overpotentials of 0.56 and 0.49 V but also high thermodynamic and electrochemical stability, as well as good selectivity towards NRR over the competing hydrogen evolution reaction. We also demonstrate the ability of Hf1-N1P2-1 and Tc1-N4 to activate and hydrogenate N2 by donating electrons and regulating charge transfer. This study not only predicts new BP-based promising catalysts but also provides guidance for the rational design of high-performance NRR electrocatalysts under ambient conditions.},

  abstract={The Sabatier principle is widely explored in heterogeneous catalysis, graphically depicted in volcano plots. The most desirable activity is located at the peak of the volcano, and further advances in activity past this optimum are possible by designing a catalyst that circumvents the limitation entailed by the Sabatier principle. Herein, by density functional theory calculations, we discovered an unusual Sabatier principle on high entropy alloy (HEA) surface, distinguishing the “just right” (ΔGH* = 0 eV) in the Sabatier principle of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). A new descriptor was proposed to design HEA catalysts for HER. As a proof-of-concept, the synthesized PtFeCoNiCu HEA catalyst endows a high catalytic performance for HER with an overpotential of 10.8 mV at −10 mA cm−2 and 4.6 times higher intrinsic activity over the state-of-the-art Pt/C. Moreover, the unusual Sabatier principle on HEA catalysts can be extended to other catalytic reactions.},

Noting a limited current density in prior reports of this transformation, a hybrid catalyst consisting of ternary metal nanodendrites mixed with a cationic ionomer, the latter purposed to increase local pH and facilitate surface proton diffusion, is investigated. This approach, when implemented using Ga-doped Ag-Cu electrocatalysts designed for p–d orbital hybridization, steered selectivity to BHMF, achieving a faradaic efficiency (FE) of 58% at 100 mA cm−2 and a production rate of 1 mmol cm−2 h−1, the latter a doubling in rate compared to the best prior reports.},

  abstract={Renewable-energy-powered electrosynthesis has the potential to contribute to decarbonizing the production of propylene glycol, a chemical that is used currently in the manufacture of polyesters and antifreeze and has a high carbon intensity. Unfortunately, to date, the electrooxidation of propylene under ambient conditions has suffered from a wide product distribution, leading to a low faradic efficiency toward the desired propylene glycol. We undertook mechanistic investigations and found that the reconstruction of Pd to PdO occurs, followed by hydroxide formation under anodic bias. The formation of this metastable hydroxide layer arrests the progressive dissolution of Pd in a locally acidic environment, increases the activity, and steers the reaction pathway toward propylene glycol. Rh-doped Pd further improves propylene glycol selectivity. Density functional theory (DFT) suggests that the Rh dopant lowers the energy associated with the production of the final intermediate in propylene glycol formation and renders the desorption step spontaneous, a concept consistent with experimental studies. We report a 75% faradic efficiency toward propylene glycol maintained over 100 h of operation.},

  abstract={Improving the kinetics and selectivity of CO2/CO electroreduction to valuable multi-carbon products is a challenge for science and is a requirement for practical relevance. Here we develop a thiol-modified surface ligand strategy that promotes electrochemical CO-to-acetate. We explore a picture wherein nucleophilic interaction between the lone pairs of sulfur and the empty orbitals of reaction intermediates contributes to making the acetate pathway more energetically accessible. Density functional theory calculations and Raman spectroscopy suggest a mechanism where the nucleophilic interaction increases the sp2 hybridization of CO(ad), facilitating the rate-determining step, CO* to (CHO)*. We find that the ligands stabilize the (HOOC–CH2)* intermediate, a key intermediate in the acetate pathway. In-situ Raman spectroscopy shows shifts in C–O, Cu–C, and C–S vibrational frequencies that agree with a picture of surface ligand-intermediate interactions. A Faradaic efficiency of 70% is obtained on optimized thiol-capped Cu catalysts, with onset potentials 100 mV lower than in the case of reference Cu catalysts.},

However, the discovery of catalysts faces challenges due to the absence of efficient approaches to navigating vast and high-dimensional structure and composition spaces. In this study, we propose a high-throughput computational catalyst screening approach integrating density functional theory (DFT) and Bayesian Optimization (BO). Within the BO framework, we propose an uncertainty-aware atomistic machine learning model, UPNet, which enables automated representation learning directly from high-dimensional catalyst structures and achieves principled uncertainty quantification. Utilizing a constrained expected improvement acquisition function, our BO framework simultaneously considers multiple evaluation criteria. Using the proposed methods, we explore catalyst discovery for the CO2 reduction reaction. The results demonstrate that our approach achieves high prediction accuracy, facilitates interpretable feature extraction, and enables multicriteria design optimization, leading to significant reduction of computing power and time (10x reduction of required DFT calculations) in high-performance catalyst discovery.},

In light of progress in electrified CO2 to ethylene, we explored routes to dimerize to 1-butene, an olefin that can serve as a building block to ethylene longer-chain alkanes. With goal of selective and active dimerization, we investigate a series of metal–organic frameworks having bimetallic catalytic sites. We find that the tunable pore structure enables optimization of selectivity and that periodic pore channels enhance activity. In a tandem system for the conversion of CO2 to 1-C4H8, wherein the outlet cathodic gas from a CO2-to-C2H4 electrolyzer is fed directly (via a dehumidification stage) into the C2H4 dimerizer, we study the highest-performing MOF found herein: M′ = Ru and M″ = Ni in the bimetallic two-dimensional M′2(OAc)4M″(CN)4 MOF. We report a 1-C4H8 production rate of 1.3 mol gcat–1 h–1 and a C2H4 conversion of 97%.
