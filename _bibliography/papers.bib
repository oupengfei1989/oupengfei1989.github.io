  abstract={A systematic investigation concerning the effects of transition metals (TM = Y, Zr, Nb, Hf, and Ta) on the structure, elasticity and thermal decomposition of the TiN-based nitride coatings with a cubic rock-salt structure has been performed in terms of first-principles calculations. Calculated lattice parameters of Ti1-xTMxN as a function of alloying concentration show positive derivations from the linearized Vegard's law, agreeing well with experimental and theoretical results. Positive enthalpies of mixing of Ti1-xTMxN (TM = Y, Zr, and Hf) indicate that the formation of these alloys is energetically unfavored with respect to the mixing of the cubic phases. The predicted consolute temperature of Ti1 − xZrxN agrees reasonably well with previous theoretical findings. The miscibility gaps disappear in the case of alloying TiN with NbN and TaN. Predicted elastic stiffness constants C11, C12, and C44 together with the aggregate polycrystalline properties of Ti1-xTMxN are determined by an efficient strain-stress method. The present results indicate that the above nitride alloys are mechanically stable and addition of Nb and Ta increases the ductility, with Ta possessing the largest effect.},

  abstract={Phase equilibria and thermodynamic properties of the Co-Hf system were investigated via calorimetric measurements, first-principles calculations and thermodynamic modeling. Heat contents of Co2Hf and CoHf2 were measured by drop calorimetry from 300 to 1200 °C. The enthalpy of formation for Co23Hf6 at 0 K was computed via first-principles calculations. Based on the experimental measurements and first-principles calculations from the present work and the literature, the Co–Hf system was assessed by means of CALPHAD (CALculation of PHAse Diagram) approach. The excess Gibbs energy of solution phases was modeled with Redlich–Kister polynomial. Sublattice models were employed to describe the homogeneity ranges of Co2Hf, CoHf and CoHf2. The order-disorder transition between B2 (CoHf) and A2 (βHf) phases was taken into account in the current optimization. Using the optimized parameters, glass forming range (GFR) of the Co-Hf amorphous alloys was predicted to be 15-75 at.% Hf, which is in satisfactory agreement with the experimental observation.},

  abstract={The polymorphism of two dimensional MoS2 promises new possibilities for nanoelectronics. The realization of those possibilities necessitates techniques to enable flexible and controllable phase engineering of MoS2. In the present study, based on first-principles calculations, a new and flexible route to engineer the phase stability of MoS2 by interfacing it with a GaN or AlN substrate is reported. Depending on the surface termination of the underlying substrate, MoS2 may exhibit either the 2H or 1T′ (1T′′) phase. The interface coupling between MoS2 and the substrate also affects the phase transition kinetics. In addition, electron doping can act as another means to influence MoS2–substrate interactions and enable further phase engineering of MoS2. The present findings contribute to new knowledge towards phase engineering of MoS2 and the design of hybrid nanodevices comprising both 2D and 3D optoelectronic materials.},

  abstract={A controllable phase transition between the semiconducting 2H phase and metallic/semimetallic T (1T, 1T′, and 1T″) isomorphs provides an effective route to tune and even switch physical and electronic properties within 2D transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). In this study, the feasibility of curvature engineering in manipulating the structural phase is investigated employing first-principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations and continuum mechanics analysis. With WSe2 and MoTe2 as TMD representatives, it is found that bending deformation can not only energetically induce 2H → T (1T, 1T′, or 1T″) phase transformation, but also kinetically facilitate the phase transition by lowering transition activation barriers. Moreover, a phase stability diagram is constructed which suggests ways of achieving both uniformly 2H → T phase transition and programming printing of T phases in 2H-TMD membranes. The theoretical results not only suggest a new feasible experimental design strategy of phase engineering, but also sheds light on novel device design with the patterning of T phases on the 2H-TMD membrane.},

  abstract={A multi-functional photocatalyst, that can combine the catalytic functions of water oxidation and proton reduction together with light harvesting capacity, is highly desired for low cost, high efficiency, and highly stable solar fuel production. Monolayer WSe2, with a direct energy gap of ~ 1.65 eV is a nearly ideal light absorber to convert sunlight to hydrogen fuels through solar water splitting. To date, however, the controlled synthesis of monolayer WSe2 on a wafer scale and the realization of overall water splitting on WSe2 have remained elusive. Here, we report the van de Waals epitaxy of crystalline monolayer WSe2 on large area amorphous SiOx substrates. We have demonstrated, for the first time, the multi-functionality of monolayer WSe2 in solar water splitting, including extraordinary capacities for efficient light harvesting, water oxidation, and proton reduction. The absorbed photon conversion efficiency exceeds 12% for a single monolayer WSe2. This work provides a viable strategy for wafer-scale synthesis of multi-functional photocatalysts for the development of efficient, low cost, and scalable solar fuel devices and systems.},

  abstract={Photoelectrochemical (PEC) reduction of CO2 with H2O not only provides an opportunity for reducing net CO2 emissions but also produces value-added chemical feedstocks and fuels. Syngas, a mixture of CO and H2, is a key feedstock for the production of methanol and other commodity hydrocarbons in industry. However, it is challenging to achieve efficient and stable PEC CO2 reduction into syngas with controlled composition owing to the difficulties associated with the chemical inertness of CO2 and complex reaction network of CO2 conversion. Herein, by employing a metal/oxide interface to spontaneously activate CO2 molecule and stabilize the key reaction intermediates, we report a benchmarking solar-to-syngas efficiency of 0.87% and a high turnover number of 24 800, as well as a desirable high stability of 10 h. Moreover, the CO/H2 ratios in the composition can be tuned in a wide range between 4:1 and 1:6 with a total unity Faradaic efficiency. On the basis of experimental measurements and theoretical calculations, we present that the metal/oxide interface provides multifunctional catalytic sites with complementary chemical properties for CO2 activation and conversion, leading to a unique pathway that is inaccessible with the individual components. The present approach opens new opportunities to rationally develop high-performance PEC systems for selective CO2 reduction into valuable carbon-based chemicals and fuels.},

  abstract={The microtubes made through rolling-up of strain-engineered nanomembranes have received growing research attention after their first invention due to the technology's high flexibility, integrability, and versatility. These rolled-up microtubes have been used for a variety of device applications including sensors, batteries and transistors, among others. This paper reports the development of highly sensitive whispering-gallery mode (WGM) chemical sensors based on rolled-up microtube optical microcavities (RUM-OCs). For the first time, such microcavities were batch fabricated through rolling-up of plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD)-synthesized SiOx/SiNx bilayer nanomembranes, which have better optical properties than the conventional electron-beam-deposited SiO/SiO2 bilayers. Benefiting from the high refractive index (RI) of PECVD-deposited SiNx, our RUM-OC shows an enhanced quality factor of 880 that is much higher than that (50) of a SiO/SiO2 RUM-OC with the same dimensions. The developed RUM-OC is used for sensitive WGM solvent sensing, and demonstrate a limit of detection of 10−4 refractive index unit (RIU), which is 10 times lower than that (10−3 RIU) of a SiO/SiO2 RUM-OC.},

  abstract={Density functional theory (DFT) calculations and ab-initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations were performed to understand graphene and its interaction with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) molecules. The adsorption energy was predicted to increase with the number of aromatic rings in the adsorbates, and linearly correlate with the hydrophobicity of PAHs. Additionally, the analysis of the electronic properties showed that PAHs behave as mild n-dopants and introduce electrons into graphene; but do not remarkably modify the band gap of graphene, indicating that the interaction between PAHs and graphene is physisorption. We have also discovered highly sensitive strain dependence on the adsorption strength of PAHs onto graphene surface. The AIMD simulation indicated that a sensitive and fast adsorption process of PAHs can be achieved by choosing graphene as the adsorbent. These findings are anticipated to shed light on the future development of graphene-based materials with potential applications in the capture and removal of persistent aromatic pollutants.},

The atomistic characteristics of dislocation and the resulting lattice distorting were first determined by generalized-stacking-fault energy profile and disregistry function obtained through Peierls-Nabarro model. Those properties were then used to calculate the accurate mismatch strain of those nanomembranes with the presence of dislocations, and as inputs into von-Karman shell theory to quantitatively evaluate the effects on self-rolling curvature and anisotropy. The theoretical results were further confirmed by atomistic simulations of different crystal geometries and dislocation configurations.

  abstract={The unique structure and prominent properties of black phosphorus (BP) and its monolayer and multilayers in device applications have attracted significant attention to this elemental 2D material. In this study, a comprehensive evaluation of the candidacy of monolayer BP as a channel material for high-performance volatile organic compound (VOC) sensors is conducted combining first-principles density functional theory calculations and non-equilibrium Green's function formalism. The adsorption configurations and energetics of several typical VOCs (ethanol, propionaldehyde, acetone, toluene, and hexane) on monolayer BP are examined and it is demonstrated that VOCs generally exhibit stronger interaction with monolayer BP than with the widely studied monolayer MoS2, indicative of monolayer BP potentially being a more sensitive VOC sensor. Monolayer BP is shown to exhibit highly anisotropic transport behaviors, whereas the absolute modification of current–voltage responses due to VOCs is found to show a trend that is direction independent. Moreover, the adsorption of VOCs on monolayer BP is strong enough to resist thermal disturbance, yet allows fast recovery time. The results suggest that BP is a compelling and feasible candidate for sensing applications of VOCs.},

  abstract={We have employed ab initio molecular dynamics simulations to study the oxidation behavior of TiAlN hard coatings as a function of Al content and temperature. Results show that for TiAlN with a low Al content (Ti0.75Al0.25N), Ti atoms can always bond with O atoms, while Al atoms bond with O only at a higher temperature. For Ti0.5Al0.5N, both Al and Ti can bond with O atoms, irrespective of temperature. Through analyzing the displacement height of O-bonded metal atoms, we suggest that titanium oxide nucleates at the outermost layer of Ti0.75Al0.25N while the outermost layer after Ti0.5Al0.5N is exposed to oxygen is aluminum oxide. Our simulation results predict, in agreement with experiment, that Ti0.5Al0.5N has superior oxidation resistance in comparison with Ti0.75Al0.25N. This study provides an atomistic insight to the initial stage of the oxidation process, which is else difficult to observe experimentally.},

Electrochemical analysis showed that silver catalyzed chalcopyrite dissolution by enhancing the electrochemical reactivity. In addition, the incorporation of silver atoms into the chalcopyrite surface might cause a major distortion in its structure and accelerated the diffusion rate of copper atoms mainly because of that the Cu+ ionic radius is much smaller than that of Ag+.

  abstract={Black phosphorus (BP) is a semiconducting material with a direct finite band gap in its monolayer, attracting intense attention for its application in field-effect transistors. However, strong Fermi level pinning (FLP) has been observed for contacts between BP and high work function metals, e.g., Cu. Such FLP presents an undesirable hurdle preventing the achievement of high performance field-effect devices. In this regard, there is a crucial need to understand the FLP occurring at the metal–BP interfaces and explore the possibility to reduce it. The present work studied atomic passivation in reducing FLP for the Cu–BP system using density functional theory calculations. The passivation by H, N, F, S, and Cl atoms on the Cu(111) surface has been considered. The results showed that the passivated atoms can shield the direct contact between Cu(111) and BP, thus reducing FLP at Cu–BP interfaces. In particular, S and Cl atoms were found to be highly effective agents to achieve a significant reduction of FLP, leading to Cu–BP contacts with ultralow Schottky barrier height (SBH) and suggesting the possibility of ohmic contact formation. Our findings demonstrate surface passivation as an effective method towards depinning the Fermi level at the metal–BP interface and subsequently controlling the SBH for BP-based electronic devices.},

However, the production of NH3 from the electrochemical nitrogen (N2) reduction reaction (NRR) under ambient conditions is one of the most important issues that remain challenging for chemists. Herein, the candidacy of a series of molybdenum (Mo)-based single-atom catalysts (SACs) supported on N-doped black phosphorus (BP) as the electrocatalyst for the NRR has been evaluated by means of density functional theory (DFT) calculations. In particular, Mo1N3 has been found to chemically adsorb N2, and it exhibits the highest catalytic activity toward the NRR with an ultralow overpotential of 0.02 V via the associative distal mechanism, indicative of catalyzing the NRR under ambient conditions. Additionally, Mo1N3 shows the fast removal of the produced NH3 with a free energy uphill of only 0.56 eV and good stability of NRR intermediates. Moreover, the Mo-based SACs were demonstrated to be more selective to the NRR over the competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) process. These excellent features render Mo1N3 on BP as a compelling highly efficient and durable catalyst for electrochemical N2 fixation. Our results provide a rational paradigm for catalytic nitrogen fixation by SACs in two-dimensional (2D) materials under ambient conditions.},

Our calculations reveal that for all of the three slip systems, all of the shuffle cores are planar glissile and mobile, while being non-planar sessile and immobile for all of the glide cores. We further show that vacancy can be used to activate the motion of glide cores via core transition from glide to shuffle, which is also valid for AlN and InN. The critical shear stresses for the motion of glide cores are also determined at various vacancy concentrations.

Six negative impulses hybrid input shapers to reduce vibration of the first two modes were constructed based on the robot. Using simulation methods, the response time and vibration suppression abilities of various negative impulses hybrid two-modal input shapers (NHTIS) were obtained by analyzing the vibration response curves of these input shapers, and comparing with positive and negative impulses two-modal input shapers, respectively. The results show that the NHTIS can improve the response speed of the system while significantly reducing the multiple-modal residual vibration.},

The methodologies and various types of multi-mode classic and hybrid input shaping control schemes with positive impulses were introduced in this paper. Six types of two-mode hybrid input shapers with positive impulses of a 3 degree of freedom robot were established. The ability and robustness of these two-mode hybrid input shapers to suppress residual vibration were analyzed by vibration response curve and sensitivity curve via numerical simulation. The response time of the zero vibration-zero vibration and derivative (ZV-ZVD) input shaper is the fastest, but the robustness is the least. The robustness of the zero vibration and derivative-extra insensitive (ZVD-EI) input shaper is the best, while the response time is the longest. According to the frequency bandwidth at each mode and required system response time, the most appropriate multi-mode hybrid input shaper (MMHIS) can be selected in order to improve response time as much as possible under the condition of suppressing more residual vibration.},

  abstract={Changing functionalities of materials using simple methods is an active area of research, as it is “green” and lowers the developing cost of new products for the enterprises. A new small molecule racemic N,N-dimethyl aspartic acid has been prepared. Its structure is determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. It is characterized by FTIR, XPS, 1H NMR, and mass spectroscopy. Its near-infrared luminescence can be enhanced by the combination of metal ions, including Dy3+, Gd3+, Nd3+, Er3+, Sr3+, Y3+, Zn2+, Zr4+, Ho3+, Yb3+, La3+, Pr6+/Pr3+, and Sm3+ ions. An optical chemistry mechanism upon interaction between the sensitizer and activator is proposed. Furthermore, the association of Ca2+, Sr2+, or Zr4+ ions to the molecule enhanced its photodegradation for dyes under white-light irradiation. Specifically, rhodamine 6G can be degraded by the Ca2+-modified molecule; rhodamine B, rhodamine 6G, and fluorescein sodium salt can be degraded by the Sr2+- or Zr4+-modified molecule. This surprising development opens a way in simultaneously increasing NIR luminescence and the ability of dye photodegradation for the investigated molecule.},

  abstract={Development for new solid substrates for protein adsorption is important, given the massive potential in a number of fields including food production, medicine, biotechnology, and pharmaceutical processing. We developed a zeolitic imidazolate framework 8 (ZIF-8)-nanoparticles based fibrous platform (Platform 1). Its ability in protein adsorption is proven by fluorescence study of Alexa Fluor 647-labeled donkey anti-rabbit IgG adsorbed on Platform 1. Studies reveal that Platform 1 shows much more enhanced protein adsorption compared to a polyethylene terephthalate gauze fibrous platform treated with ZIF-8 nanoparticles. This may be explained by considering that more active sites are enabled on fabric to adsorb a higher amount of ZIF-8 nanoparticles. We show that Platform 1 provides favorable biocompatibility to maintain the bioactivity of enzymes. Furthermore, we prove that a carboxymethylated cotton fabric platform treated with ZIF-8 (Platform 3) can be more capable of immobilizing the Alexa Fluor 647-labeled antibodies than Platform 1. Carboxymethylation helps to enhance protein adsorption in these cotton fabric substrates.},

The calculations of reaction energetics suggest that Cu and Fe in the binary system can work in synergy to significantly deform the linear configuration of CO2 and reduce the high energy barrier by stabilizing the reaction intermediates, thus spontaneously favoring CO2 activation and conversion for methane synthesis. Experimentally, the designed CuFe catalyst exhibits a high current density of −38.3 mA⋅cm−2 using industry-ready silicon photoelectrodes with an impressive methane Faradaic efficiency of up to 51%, leading to a distinct turnover frequency of 2,176 h−1 under air mass 1.5 global (AM 1.5G) one-sun illumination.},

  abstract={The vibration characteristics and damping of three-dimensional graphene honeycombs (3DGHs) were studied using molecular dynamics simulations and continuum modeling. Both zigzag and armchair 3DGHs were considered. Longitudinal harmonic excitation was applied on the free end of the cantilever honeycomb along the axial direction. Based on the curves of the vibration responses and the amplitude-frequency characteristic of the 3DGH, it was revealed that the amplitude of vibration response and the resonant frequencies of the 3DGHs were influenced by both the excitation frequency and the amplitude of the excitation force. Moreover, the vibration characteristics of the 3DGHs exhibit spring softening nonlinearity, with greater nonlinearity observed as the exciting force increases. The linear and nonlinear damping of the 3DGHs were further evaluated using the loss factor in the sub-resonant regime under various excitation forces, showing that the 3DGH as a resonator can be excited at higher frequencies of GHz with a small loss factor than graphene and CNT. This study demonstrates the relationships of resonant frequencies and damping with the frequency and amplitude of the excitation force in 3DGHs, providing theoretical foundation for designing 3DGH nanomechanical resonators.},

Doping of a RE zirconate pyrochlore has been shown to be one possible method towards additional reduction in the thermal conductivity. Focusing on lanthanum zirconate (La2Zr2O7) as a representative RE zirconate pyrochlore, we systematically investigated the effect of various doping elements, Gd, Y, Yb, In, Sc, Ce and Hf, on the thermal conductivity. A complete computational route, based on first-principles calculations, to predict the reduction of thermal conductivity by doping, has been developed. Employing first-principles calculations combined with thermodynamic modeling, the defects resulted from doping are explicitly clarified, with their concentrations determined considering the chemical environment. The phonon-defect scattering is then evaluated and the resultant reduction of thermal conductivity is determined from single-mode relaxation-time approximation. Good agreement has been achieved between our model predictions and available experimental data. The present study established a complete computational route, based on first-principles calculations, to predict the reduction of thermal conductivity by doping, not only for RE zirconate pyrochlores, but also for other complex oxide ceramics.},

  abstract={Temperature-adjustable optical properties of two types of one-dimensional photonic superlattices made from lithium niobate or liquid crystal are theoretically investigated. The control of band structures and density of states is achieved through the temperature with various values of refractive index, layer width, and propagation wavelength. It is presented that a null photonic gap appears at certain temperature points, which are decided by the ratio of layer width and the refractive index. It is shown that the spatial average of the wave vector ⟨k⟩ vanishes at a specific temperature as functions of the layer thickness and refractive index. The values of the temperature corresponding to zero-refractive-index (zero-⟨n⟩) are demonstrated to be suppressed when the refractive index or the ratio of the layer width is enhanced. Null photonic gap and zero-⟨n⟩ can appear simultaneously at certain wavelengths in the range of visible light, which can be modulated by the temperature. This implies the importance of one-dimensional photonic superlattices made from temperature-controllable-refractive-index materials for many important practical applications.},

Pr2S3 is found to be used in selective photodegradation of fluorescein sodium salt. MoS2 can be utilized for selective photodegradation of rhodamine B. In the mixture of rhodamine B, fluorescein sodium salt and rhodamine 6 G, most of rhodamine B and part of fluorescein sodium salt are optically degraded by Pr2S3. In the mixture of rhodamine B, fluorescein sodium salt and rhodamine 6 G, part of fluorescein sodium salt and most of rhodamine B is degraded by MoS2.

  abstract={The electrochemical reduction of N2 to NH3 is emerging as a promising alternative for sustainable and distributed production of NH3. However, the development has been impeded by difficulties in N2 adsorption, protonation of *NN, and inhibition of competing hydrogen evolution. To address the issues, we design a catalyst with diatomic Pd-Cu sites on N-doped carbon by modulation of single-atom Pd sites with Cu. The introduction of Cu not only shifts the partial density of states of Pd toward the Fermi level but also promotes the d-2π* coupling between Pd and adsorbed N2, leading to enhanced chemisorption and activated protonation of N2, and suppressed hydrogen evolution. As a result, the catalyst achieves a high Faradaic efficiency of 24.8±0.8 % and a desirable NH3 yield rate of 69.2±2.5 μg h−1 mgcat.−1, far outperforming the individual single-atom Pd catalyst.

Here, we report our findings in electrochemical NRR for ammonia synthesis using porous bimetallic Pd–Ag nanocatalysts in both gas-phase and liquid-phase electrochemical cells at current densities above 1 mA cm–2 under ambient conditions. While the gas-phase cell has lower Ohmic losses and higher energy efficiency, the liquid-phase cell achieved higher selectivity and Faradaic efficiency, attributed to the presence of concentrated N2 molecules dissolved in an aqueous electrolyte and the hydration effects. The liquid cell demonstrated notable performance for electrocatalytic NRR, achieving an NH3 production rate of 45.6 ± 3.7 μg cm–2 h–1 at a cell voltage of −0.6 V (vs RHE) and current density of 1.1 mA cm–2, corresponding to a Faradaic efficiency of ∼19.6% and an energy efficiency of ∼9.9%. Similarly, the gas-phase cell achieved a NH3 yield rate of 19.4 ± 2.1 μg cm–2 h–1 at −0.07 V (vs RHE) and 1.15 mA cm–2 with a Faradaic efficiency of 7.9% and an energy efficiency of 27.1%. Further, operando surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT) are used to identify intermediate species relevant to the NRR at the electrode–electrolyte interfaces to provide insights into the NRR mechanism on Pd–Ag nanoparticles.

Results of DFT calculations reveal the underlying mechanism that Cu2+ can selectively replace zinc in marmatite lattices and further diffuse into the matrix. Additionally, a strong correlation between the cupric ion consumption with the pH value variation is discussed and the effects of the formed new phase on the dissolution kinetics of marmatite were researched.

  abstract={Two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides (2D TMDCs) have attracted tremendous interest as a prominent material group providing inexpensive electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). In the present study, using monolayer MoTe2 as a representative, we demonstrated that phase boundaries can provide a viable pathway to activate the basal plane of 2D TMDCs for enhanced HER performance. Comprehensive first-principles calculations have been performed to examine the energetics and structural stabilities of possible 2H/1T′ phase boundary configurations. Three categories of sites, Te, Mo and hollow sites, have been identified at energetically stable phase boundaries, as potential catalytic centers for the HER, all indicating enhanced HER activity compared to that of the pristine basal lattice. In particular, the hollow sites, a new group of sites induced by phase boundaries, show great promise by exhibiting a Gibbs free energy (ΔGH) near the thermoneutral value for hydrogen adsorption, comparable to that of Pt. The mechanisms underlying hydrogen adsorption at phase boundaries were then revealed, shown to be attributed to the unique local hydrogen adsorption geometries and electronic structures at phase boundaries. Our study clarifies the important mechanistic aspects underlying hydrogen activation at phase boundaries, providing valuable theoretical insights into designing a new class of high-performance HER electrocatalysts based on 2D TMDCs.},

Based on density functional theory calculations, the hydrogen adsorption on FeFAL:GaN NWs is found to exhibit a significantly low free energy of −0.13 eV, indicative of high activity. Meanwhile, its outstanding optoelectronic properties are realized by the strong electronic coupling between atomic iron layers and GaN(10ī0) together with the nearly defect-free GaN NWs.

Rolled-up nanotechnology, as a batch fabrication strategy for generating three-dimensional (3D) microtubes, has been demonstrated to possess unique advantages for constructing FET biosensors. In this paper, we report a new approach combining the two fascinating technologies, the FET biosensor and the rolled-up microtube, to develop a microfluidic diagnostic biosensor. We integrated an excellent biosensing III-nitride material—indium nitride (InN)—into a rolled-up microtube and used it as the FET channel. The InN possesses strong, intrinsic, and stable electron accumulation (~1013 cm−2) on its surface, thereby providing a high device sensitivity. Multiple rolled-up InN microtube FET biosensors fabricated on the same substrate were integrated with a microfluidic channel for convenient fluids handling, and shared the same external electrode (inserted into the microchannel outlet) for gating voltage modulation. Using human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibody as a model disease marker, we characterized the analytical performance of the developed biosensor and achieved a limit of detection (LOD) of 2.5 pM for serum samples spiked with HIV gp41 antibodies. The rolled-up InN microtube FET biosensor represents a new type of III-nitride-based FET biosensor and holds significant potential for practical POC diagnosis.},

  abstract={The renewable-electricity-powered CO2 electroreduction reaction provides a promising means to store intermittent renewable energy in the form of valuable chemicals and dispatchable fuels. Renewable methane produced using CO2 electroreduction attracts interest due to the established global distribution network; however, present-day efficiencies and activities remain below those required for practical application. Here we exploit the fact that the suppression of *CO dimerization and hydrogen evolution promotes methane selectivity: we reason that the introduction of Au in Cu favors *CO protonation vs. C−C coupling under low *CO coverage and weakens the *H adsorption energy of the surface, leading to a reduction in hydrogen evolution. We construct experimentally a suite of Au-Cu catalysts and control *CO availability by regulating CO2 concentration and reaction rate. This strategy leads to a 1.6× improvement in the methane:H2 selectivity ratio compared to the best prior reports operating above 100 mA cm−2. We as a result achieve a CO2-to-methane Faradaic efficiency (FE) of (56 ± 2)% at a production rate of (112 ± 4) mA cm−2.},

  abstract={Using large-scale molecular dynamics (MD) simulations in conjunction with continuum modeling, the deformation behaviors of three-dimensional (3D) graphene honeycomb structures under uniaxial in-plane compression have been systematically investigated. The stress-strain responses of graphene honeycombs were found to be dependent on the loading direction, prism size and lattice orientation, but little affected by the junction type. Two critical deformation events, i.e., elastic buckling and structural collapse, were identified, with the associated local and global structural changes associated at these critical events clarified. Continuum models accounting for the effect of lattice orientation and size-dependent yielding have been developed to quantitatively predict the threshold stresses for those critical deformation events. In addition, it has been demonstrated that the overall stress-strain curve of graphene honeycomb can also be reasonably well predicted via continuum modeling, albeit deviation at large strains due to effect of junction on cell wall bending. The present study provides critical mechanistic understanding and predictive tools for optimizing and designing 3D graphene honeycombs in small-scale applications.},

Various adsorption characteristics, including the geometry, adsorption energy, charge transfer, band structure, and curvature effect were examined. Compared with MLBP, BPNTs are found to generally exhibit similar adsorption energy towards these molecules, whereas show selectively much stronger interaction with NO2. Analysis of charge density difference and band structure also indicates the electronic properties of BPNTs are significantly altered after the adsorption of NO2: transferring an indirect band gap of ~0.3 eV for pristine (0, 9)BPNT to a metallic system. These facts collectively indicate the higher capability, sensitivity, and selectivity of BPNTs in the detection of NO2 compared to its planar counterpart. Moreover, the NO2 adsorption is found to be influenced by the curvature of BPNTs. Overall, findings from the present study indicate that BPNTs may serve as potential building blocks for high-performance gas sensors towards NO2 sensing.},

  abstract={Electrochemical CO2 reduction is a promising way to mitigate CO2 emissions and close the anthropogenic carbon cycle. Among products from CO2RR, multicarbon chemicals, such as ethylene and ethanol with high energy density, are more valuable. However, the selectivity and reaction rate of C2 production are unsatisfactory due to the sluggish thermodynamics and kinetics of C–C coupling. The electric field and thermal field have been studied and utilized to promote catalytic reactions, as they can regulate the thermodynamic and kinetic barriers of reactions. Either raising the potential or heating the electrolyte can enhance C–C coupling, but these come at the cost of increasing side reactions, such as the hydrogen evolution reaction. Here, we present a generic strategy to enhance the local electric field and temperature simultaneously and dramatically improve the electric–thermal synergy desired in electrocatalysis. A conformal coating of ∼5 nm of polytetrafluoroethylene significantly improves the catalytic ability of copper nanoneedles (∼7-fold electric field and ∼40 K temperature enhancement at the tips compared with bare copper nanoneedles experimentally), resulting in an improved C2 Faradaic efficiency of over 86% at a partial current density of more than 250 mA cm–2 and a record-high C2 turnover frequency of 11.5 ± 0.3 s–1 Cu site–1. Combined with its low cost and scalability, the electric–thermal strategy for a state-of-the-art catalyst not only offers new insight into improving activity and selectivity of value-added C2 products as we demonstrated but also inspires advances in efficiency and/or selectivity of other valuable electro-/photocatalysis such as hydrogen evolution, nitrogen reduction, and hydrogen peroxide electrosynthesis.},

  abstract={The contact nature when monolayer blue phosphorus (blueP) interfaces with three transition metal electrodes (i.e., Pd, Ir, and Pt) was unraveled by the ab initio density functional theory calculations. Specifically, n-type Schottky contact is observed for Ir(1 1 1)-blueP, in contrast, p-type Schottky contacts are formed for Pd(1 1 1)- and Pt(1 1 1)-blueP. The Fermi level is pinned partially at metal-blueP interfaces due to two interfacial behaviors: one being the modification of metal work function caused by interface dipole formation ascribed to a redistribution of charges, and the other being the production of gap states that are dominated by P p-orbitals since the intralayer Psingle bondP bonds are weakened by the interfacial metal-P interactions. The incorporation of metal substrates would also significantly alter the chemical properties of the adsorbed monolayer blueP. The binding strength of hydrogen can be enhanced by as much as 0.9 eV, which resulted from two parts: one is the charge transfer from metal substrate to monolayer blueP rendering a stronger Hsingle bondP coupling; the other is a strong interfacial interaction after the hydrogen adsorption. The free energy change of H adsorption onto Ir(1 1 1)-blueP is as low as 0.16 eV which is comparable to the most efficient catalyst of Pt. These findings would provide theoretical guidance for the future design of electronic devices based on blueP and exploration of its potential in novel catalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction.},

Here, single-atom catalysts based on 37 monometallic elements are synthesized using a dissolution-and-carbonization method, characterized and analysed to build the largest reported library of single-atom catalysts. In conjunction with in situ studies, we uncover unified principles on the oxidation state, coordination number, bond length, coordination element and metal loading of single atoms to guide the design of single-atom catalysts with atomically dispersed atoms anchored on N-doped carbon. We utilize the library to open up complex multimetallic phase spaces for single-atom catalysts and demonstrate that there is no fundamental limit on using single-atom anchor sites as structural units to assemble concentration-complex single-atom catalyst materials with up to 12 different elements. Our work offers a single-atom library spanning from monometallic to concentration-complex multimetallic materials for the rational design of single-atom catalysts.},

  abstract={Carbon dioxide/monoxide (CO2/CO) electrolysis provides a means to convert emissions into multicarbon products. However, impractical energy and carbon efficiencies limit current systems. Here we show that these inefficiencies originate from uncontrolled gas/ion distributions in the local reaction environment. Understanding of the flows of cations and anions motivated us to seek a route to block cation migration to the catalyst surface—a strategy we instantiate using a covalent organic framework (COF) in bulk heterojunction with a catalyst. The π-conjugated hydrophobic COFs constrain cation (potassium) diffusion via cation–π interactions, while promoting anion (hydroxide) and gaseous feedstock adsorption on the catalyst surface. As a result, a COF-mediated catalyst enables electrosynthesis of multicarbon products from CO for 200 h at a single-pass carbon efficiency of 95%, an energy efficiency of 40% and a current density of 240 mA cm−2.},

By developing operando methods compatible with high pressures, including quantitative operando Raman spectroscopy, we link the high formate selectivity to increased CO2 coverage on the cathode surface. The interplay of theory and experiments validates the mechanism, and guides us to functionalize the surface of a Cu cathode with a proton-resistant layer to further the pressure-mediated selectivity effect.

  abstract={Direct electrolysis of pH-neutral seawater to generate hydrogen is an attractive approach for storing renewable energy. However, due to the anodic competition between the chlorine evolution and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), direct seawater splitting suffers from a low current density and limited operating stability. Exploration of catalysts enabling an OER overpotential below the hypochlorite formation overpotential (≈490 mV) is critical to suppress the chloride evolution and facilitate seawater splitting. Here, a proton-adsorption-promoting strategy to increase the OER rate is reported, resulting in a promoted and more stable neutral seawater splitting. The best catalysts herein are strong-proton-adsorption (SPA) materials such as palladium-doped cobalt oxide (Co3–xPdxO4) catalysts. These achieve an OER overpotential of 370 mV at 10 mA cm−2 in pH-neutral simulated seawater, outperforming Co3O4 by a margin of 70 mV. Co3–xPdxO4 catalysts provide stable catalytic performance for 450 h at 200 mA cm−2 and 20 h at 1 A cm−2 in neutral seawater. Experimental studies and theoretical calculations suggest that the incorporation of SPA cations accelerates the rate-determining water dissociation step in neutral OER pathway, and control studies rule out the provision of additional OER sites as a main factor herein.},

  abstract={Electrosynthesis of multicarbon products from the reduction of CO2 in acidic electrolytes is a promising approach to overcoming CO2 reactant loss in alkaline and neutral electrolytes; however, the proton-rich environment near the catalyst surface favours the hydrogen evolution reaction, leading to low energy efficiency for multicarbon products. Here we report a heterogeneous catalyst adlayer—composed of covalent organic framework nanoparticles and cation-exchange ionomers—that suppresses hydrogen evolution and promotes CO2-to-multicarbon conversion in strong acid. The imine and carbonyl-functionalized covalent organic framework regulates the ionomer structure, creating evenly distributed cation-carrying and hydrophilic–hydrophobic nanochannels that control the catalyst microenvironment. The resulting high local alkalinity and cation-enriched environment enables C–C coupling between 100 and 400 mA cm−2. A multicarbon Faradaic efficiency of 75% is achieved at 200 mA cm−2. The system demonstrates a full-cell multicarbon energy efficiency of 25%, which is a twofold improvement over the literature benchmark acidic system for the reduction of CO2.},

  abstract={Molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) nanolayers are one of the most promising two-dimensional (2D) nanomaterials for constructing next-generation field-effect transistor (FET) biosensors. In this article, we report an ultrasensitive FET biosensor that integrates a novel format of 2D MoS2, vertically-aligned MoS2 nanolayers (VAMNs), as the channel material for label-free detection of the prostate-specific antigen (PSA). The developed VAMNs-based FET biosensor shows two distinctive advantages. First, the VAMNs can be facilely grown using the conventional chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method, permitting easy fabrication and potential mass device production. Second, the unique advantage of the VAMNs for biosensor development lies in its abundant surface-exposed active edge sites that possess a high binding affinity with thiol-based linkers, which overcomes the challenge of molecule functionalization on the conventional planar MoS2 nanolayers. The high binding affinity between 11-mercaptoundecanoic acid and the VAMNs was demonstrated through experimental surface characterization and theoretical calculations via density functional theory. The FET biosensor allows rapid (within 20 min) and ultrasensitive PSA detection in human serum with simple operations (limit of detection: 800 fg mL−1). This FET biosensor offers excellent features such as ultrahigh sensitivity, ease of fabrication, and short assay time, and thereby possesses significant potential for early-stage diagnosis of life-threatening diseases.},

Herein, guided by computation, we present a supramolecular approach that utilizes oxygen functional groups in a carbon nanotube substrate that—when coupled with a cobalt phthalocyanine catalyst—improve cobalt phthalocyanine adsorption, preventing agglomeration; and that further generate an electron-deficient Co centre whose interaction with the key H2O2 intermediate is tuned towards optimality. The catalysts exhibit an overpotential of 280 mV at 300 mA cm−2 with turnover frequencies over 50 s−1 in a neutral medium, an order of magnitude higher activity compared with the highest performing prior H2O2 electrocatalysts.

  abstract={Acetic acid is an important chemical feedstock. The electrocatalytic synthesis of acetic acid from CO2 offers a low-carbon alternative to traditional synthetic routes, but the direct reduction from CO2 comes with a CO2 crossover energy penalty. CO electroreduction bypasses this, which motivates the interest in a cascade synthesis approach of CO2 to CO followed by CO to acetic acid. Here we report a catalyst design strategy in which off-target intermediates (such as ethylene and ethanol) in the reduction of CO to acetate are destabilized. On the optimized Ag–CuO2 catalyst, this destabilization of off-target intermediates leads to an acetate Faradaic efficiency of 70% at 200 mA cm−2. We demonstrate 18 hours of stable operation in a membrane electrode assembly; the system produced 5 wt% acetate at 100 mA cm−2 and a full-cell energy efficiency of 25%, a twofold improvement on the highest energy-efficient electrosynthesis in prior reports.},

Here we present a cascade C1–C2–C4 system that combines electrochemical and thermochemical reactors to produce C4H10 selectively at ambient conditions. In a C2H4 dimerization reactor, we directly upgrade the gas outlet stream of the CO2 or CO electrolyser without purification. We find that CO, which is present alongside C2H4, enhances C2H4 dimerization selectivity to give C4H10 to 95%, a much higher performance than when a CO2 electrolyser is used instead. We achieve an overall two-stage CO-to-C4H10 cascade selectivity of 43%. Mechanistic investigations, complemented by density functional theory calculations reveal that increased CO coverage favours C2H4 dimerization and hydrogenation of *CxHy adsorbates, as well as destabilizes the *C4H9 intermediate, and so promotes the selective production of the target alkane.},

  abstract={Electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) to high-value product, CO, not only provides a key feedstock for the well-established Fischer—Tropsch process but also mitigates the greenhouse effect. However, it suffers from sluggish reaction kinetics, competitive hydrogen evolution reaction, and low selectivity. Herein, we report non-precious Cu-Sn diatomic sites anchored on nitrogen-doped porous carbon (CuSn/NPC) as an efficient catalyst for CO2RR to CO. The catalyst exhibits outstanding selectivity with CO Faradaic efficiency (FE) up to 99.1%, much higher than those of individual Cu (66.2%) and Sn (51.3%) single-atom catalysts. Moreover, high stability is confirmed by consecutive 24 h electrolysis with high selectivity from CO2 to CO. Theoretical calculations reveal an obvious activation of CO2 with weakened C—O bonds and distorted CO2 configuration upon chemisorption on the CuSn/NPC catalyst. It is also suggested CuSn/NPC is more selective for the CO2RR with dominant CO production during the electrolysis, rather than the competing hydrogen evolution reaction.},

  abstract={Two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides (2D TMDCs) show promise as potential inexpensive electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). However, their performance is bottlenecked by the inertness of the basal plane. The present study demonstrates alloying as a viable route to address such limitations. A machine learning workflow based on density functional theory (DFT) calculations has been established to predict the HER activity and stability for a series of 2D cation-mixed TMDC alloys of various compositions. The results showed that alloying exhibits a substantial effect in reducing the Gibbs free energy of hydrogen adsorption (ΔGH) on the basal plane, able to render optimal ΔGH for the HER for certain TMDC alloys. The stability prediction of these TMDC alloys further showed their potential to be synthesized in experiments. The mechanism underlying this alloying induced basal plane activation originates from the electronic effect, in particular the p-band shifting, resulting from the chemical composition variation. The findings are expected to serve as guidance for the rational design and discovery of TMDC alloys for catalytic applications.},

We posited that limited adsorbed hydroxide species in acidic CO2 reduction could contribute to a low selectivity to multicarbon products. Here we report an electrodeposited Cu catalyst that suppresses hydrogen formation and promotes selective CO2 reduction in acidic conditions. Using in situ time-resolved Raman spectroscopy, we show that a high concentration of CO and OH on the catalyst surface promotes C-C coupling, a finding that we correlate with evidence of increased CO residence time. The optimized electrodeposited Cu catalyst achieves a 60% faradaic efficiency for ethylene and 90% for multicarbon products. When deployed in a slim flow cell, the catalyst attains a 20% energy efficiency to ethylene, and 30% to multicarbon products.},

Acetate is one such C2 compound on the path to the large but fossil-derived acetic acid market. Here we pursued dispersing a low concentration of Cu atoms in a host metal to favour the stabilization of ketenes10—chemical intermediates that are bound in monodentate fashion to the electrocatalyst.

Operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy indicates in situ-generated Cu clusters consisting of <4 atoms as active sites. We report a 12:1 ratio, an order of magnitude increase compared to the best previous reports, in the selectivity for acetate relative to all other products observed from the carbon monoxide electroreduction reaction. Combining catalyst design and reactor engineering, we achieve a CO-to-acetate Faradaic efficiency of 91% and report a Faradaic efficiency of 85% with an 820-h operating time.

We reasoned that replacing the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with anodic electrosynthesis of acetic acid from ethanol at industrial current densities could be a route to increase the economic efficiency of green hydrogen production. We partition the selective oxidation of ethanol to acetic acid into two mechanistically distinct transformations: first ethanol oxidation followed by the production of *OH. Density functional theory (DFT) studies show that the aldehyde-derived intermediate CH3CO* from ethanol oxidation and the *OH radical from water dissociation are both needed in the electroproduction of acetic acid. Operando Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy identifies the corresponding aldehyde intermediates on the anode surface.

  abstract={With the electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR) being a promising method to reduce atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2), transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs), such as molybdenum disulfide (MoS2), have recently risen as potential catalysts for CO2RR. However, pristine TMDCs are bottlenecked by the insufficiency of active sites in the basal plane. In this study, focusing on polycrystalline MoS2, we perform systematic density functional theory calculations to investigate the role of grain boundaries (GBs) on the catalytic performance of MoS2 for CO2RR. Our results show that most GBs contribute to lowering the reaction energy of the potential-limiting step in CO2RR. This effect can be further amplified with the introduction of S vacancies. In addition, the introduction of GBs with vacancies is shown to act as an effective method to break the scaling relations between reaction intermediates, which is crucial in improving catalytic efficiencies. Our findings demonstrate that defect engineering holds great potential to activate the basal plane of TMDCs for CO2RR, providing valuable insights into engineering TMDCs for high-performing CO2RR electrocatalysts.},

  abstract={Electrocatalysts for highly efficient oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) are crucial for energy conversion and storage devices. Single-atom catalysts with maximized metal utilization and altered electronic structure are the most promising alternatives to replace current benchmark precious metals. However, the atomic level understanding of the functional role for each species at the anchoring sites is still unclear and poorly elucidated. Herein, we report Fe single atom catalysts with the sulfur and oxygen functional groups near the atomically dispersed metal centers (Fe1/NSOC) for highly efficient ORR. The Fe1/NSOC delivers a half-wave potential of 0.92 V vs. RHE, which is much better than those of commercial Pt/C (0.88 V), Fe single atoms on N-doped carbon (Fe1/NC, 0.89 V) and most reported nonprecious metal catalysts. The spectroscopic measurements reveal that the presence of sulfur group induces the formation of epoxy groups near the FeN4S2 centers, which not only modulate the electronic structure of Fe single atoms but also participate the catalytic process to improve the kinetics. The density functional theory calculations demonstrate the existence of sulfur and epoxy group engineer the charges of Fe reactive center and facilitate the reductive release of OH* (rate-limiting step), thus boosting the overall oxygen reduction efficiency.},

  abstract={Electrochemical conversion of CO2 to high-value chemical fuels offers a promising strategy for managing the global carbon balance but faces huge challenges due to the lack of effective electrocatalysts. Here, we reported PdCu3 alloy nanoparticles with abundant exposed (110) facets supported on N-doped three-dimensional interconnected carbon frameworks (PdCu3/NC) as an efficient and durable electrocatalyst for electrochemical CO2 reduction to CO. The catalyst exhibits extremely high intrinsic CO2 reduction selectivity for CO production with a Faraday efficiency of nearly 100% at a mild potential of −0.5 V. Moreover, a rechargeable high-performance Zn–CO2 battery with PdCu3/NC as a cathode is developed to deliver a record-high energy efficiency of 99.2% at 0.5 mA cm–2 and rechargeable stability of up to 133 h.

  abstract={Cement production is a carbon-intensive industrial process, with the sector contributing ∼8% of global anthropogenic CO2 emissions. On average, producing each kilogram of cement leads to the emission of 1 kg of CO2─the combination of fuel combustion emissions and carbon released from the feedstock, limestone (CaCO3). Here we report electrochemical cement production based on anion-mediated electrochemical calcium extraction (ECE) that addresses both feedstock and energy emissions. The in situ-generated acidic electrolytes release the feedstock CO2 emissions at high purity, enabling direct carbon utilization or sequestration without costly capture and purification steps. Energy embodied within a separate H2 output stream is sufficient to sinter Ca(OH)2 to produce portland cement, thus removing the CO2 emissions associated with fuel combustion. We then replace CaCO3 with a carbon-free calcium feedstock, gypsum, thereby removing the CO2 emissions embodied in the feedstock. Technoeconomic analysis forecasts that this method could provide a viable, decarbonized cement alternative.},

  abstract={Potential applications of III-nitrides have led to their monolayer allotropes, i.e., two-dimensional (2D) III-nitrides, having attracted much attention. Recently, alloying has been demonstrated as an effective method to control the properties of 2D materials. In this study, the stability, and the electronic and chemical properties of monolayer Ga(1−x)AlxN alloys were investigated employing density functional theory (DFT) calculations and the cluster expansion (CE) method. The results show that 2D Ga(1−x)AlxN alloys are thermodynamically stable and complete miscibility in the alloys can be achieved at ambient temperature (>85 K). By analyzing CE results, the atomic arrangement of 2D Ga(1−x)AlxN was revealed, showing that Ga/Al atoms tend to mix with the Al/Ga atoms in their next nearest site. The band gaps of Ga(1−x)AlxN random alloys can be tuned by varying the chemical composition, and the corresponding bowing parameter was calculated as −0.17 eV. Biaxial tensile strain was also found to change the band gap values of Ga(1−x)AlxN random alloys ascribed to its modifications to the CBM positions. The chemical properties of Ga(1−x)AlxN can also be significantly altered by strain, making them good candidates as photocatalysts for water splitting. The present study can play a crucial role in designing and optimizing 2D III-nitrides for next-generation electronics and photocatalysis.},

  abstract={The electrochemical reduction of CO2 in acidic conditions enables high single-pass carbon efficiency. However, the competing hydrogen evolution reaction reduces selectivity in the electrochemical reduction of CO2, a reaction in which the formation of CO, and its ensuing coupling, are each essential to achieving multicarbon (C2+) product formation. These two reactions rely on distinct catalyst properties that are difficult to achieve in a single catalyst. Here we report decoupling the CO2-to-C2+ reaction into two steps, CO2-to-CO and CO-to-C2+, by deploying two distinct catalyst layers operating in tandem to achieve the desired transformation. The first catalyst, atomically dispersed cobalt phthalocyanine, reduces CO2 to CO with high selectivity. This process increases local CO availability to enhance the C–C coupling step implemented on the second catalyst layer, which is a Cu nanocatalyst with a Cu–ionomer interface. The optimized tandem electrodes achieve 61% C2H4 Faradaic efficiency and 82% C2+ Faradaic efficiency at 800 mA cm−2 at 25 °C. When optimized for single-pass utilization, the system reaches a single-pass carbon efficiency of 90 ± 3%, simultaneous with 55 ± 3% C2H4 Faradaic efficiency and a total C2+ Faradaic efficiency of 76 ± 2%, at 800 mA cm−2 with a CO2 flow rate of 2 ml min−1.},

  abstract={Electrosynthesis of acetate from CO offers the prospect of a low-carbon-intensity route to this valuable chemical––but only once sufficient selectivity, reaction rate and stability are realized. It is a high priority to achieve the protonation of the relevant intermediates in a controlled fashion, and to achieve this while suppressing the competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and while steering multicarbon (C2+) products to a single valuable product––an example of which is acetate. Here we report interface engineering to achieve solid/liquid/gas triple-phase interface regulation, and we find that it leads to site-selective protonation of intermediates and the preferential stabilization of the ketene intermediates: this, we find, leads to improved selectivity and energy efficiency toward acetate. Once we further tune the catalyst composition and also optimize for interfacial water management, we achieve a cadmium-copper catalyst that shows an acetate Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 75% with ultralow HER (<0.2% H2 FE) at 150 mA cm−2. We develop a high-pressure membrane electrode assembly system to increase CO coverage by controlling gas reactant distribution and achieve 86% acetate FE simultaneous with an acetate full-cell energy efficiency (EE) of 32%, the highest energy efficiency reported in direct acetate electrosynthesis.},

  abstract={The discovery of metal-nitrogen centers as the active sites for electrolysis has aroused significant interest in utilizing single-atom catalysts for nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR). Properly designed nanostructured catalysts that strongly interact with nitrogen molecules (N2) can promote adsorption and activation, thereby resulting in efficient catalysts with high stability, activity, and selectivity. In this study, using density functional theory calculations, we selected monolayer black phosphorus (BP) as the substrate and screened a series of single-atom transition metals confined in tri-coordinated and tetra-coordinated active centers (without and with N dopants) to electro-catalyze NRR. As a result, we have identified two promising candidates (Hf1-N1P2-1 and Tc1-N4), which exhibit not only low overpotentials of 0.56 and 0.49 V but also high thermodynamic and electrochemical stability, as well as good selectivity towards NRR over the competing hydrogen evolution reaction. We also demonstrate the ability of Hf1-N1P2-1 and Tc1-N4 to activate and hydrogenate N2 by donating electrons and regulating charge transfer. This study not only predicts new BP-based promising catalysts but also provides guidance for the rational design of high-performance NRR electrocatalysts under ambient conditions.},

A new descriptor was proposed to design HEA catalysts for HER. As a proof-of-concept, the synthesized PtFeCoNiCu HEA catalyst endows a high catalytic performance for HER with an overpotential of 10.8 mV at −10 mA cm−2 and 4.6 times higher intrinsic activity over the state-of-the-art Pt/C.

  abstract={Renewable-energy-powered electrosynthesis has the potential to contribute to decarbonizing the production of propylene glycol, a chemical that is used currently in the manufacture of polyesters and antifreeze and has a high carbon intensity. Unfortunately, to date, the electrooxidation of propylene under ambient conditions has suffered from a wide product distribution, leading to a low faradic efficiency toward the desired propylene glycol. We undertook mechanistic investigations and found that the reconstruction of Pd to PdO occurs, followed by hydroxide formation under anodic bias. The formation of this metastable hydroxide layer arrests the progressive dissolution of Pd in a locally acidic environment, increases the activity, and steers the reaction pathway toward propylene glycol. Rh-doped Pd further improves propylene glycol selectivity. Density functional theory (DFT) suggests that the Rh dopant lowers the energy associated with the production of the final intermediate in propylene glycol formation and renders the desorption step spontaneous, a concept consistent with experimental studies. We report a 75% faradic efficiency toward propylene glycol maintained over 100 h of operation.},

Here we develop a thiol-modified surface ligand strategy that promotes electrochemical CO-to-acetate. We explore a picture wherein nucleophilic interaction between the lone pairs of sulfur and the empty orbitals of reaction intermediates contributes to making the acetate pathway more energetically accessible. Density functional theory calculations and Raman spectroscopy suggest a mechanism where the nucleophilic interaction increases the sp2 hybridization of CO(ad), facilitating the rate-determining step, CO* to (CHO)*. We find that the ligands stabilize the (HOOC–CH2)* intermediate, a key intermediate in the acetate pathway. In-situ Raman spectroscopy shows shifts in C–O, Cu–C, and C–S vibrational frequencies that agree with a picture of surface ligand-intermediate interactions. A Faradaic efficiency of 70% is obtained on optimized thiol-capped Cu catalysts, with onset potentials 100 mV lower than in the case of reference Cu catalysts.},

Utilizing a constrained expected improvement acquisition function, our BO framework simultaneously considers multiple evaluation criteria. Using the proposed methods, we explore catalyst discovery for the CO2 reduction reaction.
