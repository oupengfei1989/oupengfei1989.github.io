However, the competing hydrogen evolution reaction reduces selectivity in the electrochemical reduction of CO2, a reaction in which the formation of CO, and its ensuing coupling, are each essential to achieving multicarbon (C2+) product formation. These two reactions rely on distinct catalyst properties that are difficult to achieve in a single catalyst. Here we report decoupling the CO2-to-C2+ reaction into two steps, CO2-to-CO and CO-to-C2+, by deploying two distinct catalyst layers operating in tandem to achieve the desired transformation. The first catalyst, atomically dispersed cobalt phthalocyanine, reduces CO2 to CO with high selectivity. This process increases local CO availability to enhance the C–C coupling step implemented on the second catalyst layer, which is a Cu nanocatalyst with a Cu–ionomer interface. The optimized tandem electrodes achieve 61% C2H4 Faradaic efficiency and 82% C2+ Faradaic efficiency at 800 mA cm−2 at 25 °C. When optimized for single-pass utilization, the system reaches a single-pass carbon efficiency of 90 ± 3%, simultaneous with 55 ± 3% C2H4 Faradaic efficiency and a total C2+ Faradaic efficiency of 76 ± 2%, at 800 mA cm−2 with a CO2 flow rate of 2 ml min−1.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="wang2024site" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Site-selective protonation enables efficient carbon monoxide electroreduction to acetate</div> <div class="author"> Xinyue Wang✝, Yuanjun Chen✝, Feng Li✝, Rui Kai Miao✝, Jianan Erick Huang, Zilin Zhao, Xiao-Yan Li, Roham Dorakhan, Senlin Chu, Jinhong Wu, Sixing Zheng, Weiyan Ni, Dongha Kim, Sungjin Park, Yongxiang Liang, Adnan Ozden, <em>Pengfei Ou</em>, Yang Hou*, David Sinton*, and Edward H.

It is a high priority to achieve the protonation of the relevant intermediates in a controlled fashion, and to achieve this while suppressing the competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and while steering multicarbon (C2+) products to a single valuable product––an example of which is acetate. Here we report interface engineering to achieve solid/liquid/gas triple-phase interface regulation, and we find that it leads to site-selective protonation of intermediates and the preferential stabilization of the ketene intermediates: this, we find, leads to improved selectivity and energy efficiency toward acetate. Once we further tune the catalyst composition and also optimize for interfacial water management, we achieve a cadmium-copper catalyst that shows an acetate Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 75% with ultralow HER (&lt;0.2% H2 FE) at 150 mA cm−2.

Properly designed nanostructured catalysts that strongly interact with nitrogen molecules (N2) can promote adsorption and activation, thereby resulting in efficient catalysts with high stability, activity, and selectivity. In this study, using density functional theory calculations, we selected monolayer black phosphorus (BP) as the substrate and screened a series of single-atom transition metals confined in tri-coordinated and tetra-coordinated active centers (without and with N dopants) to electro-catalyze NRR. As a result, we have identified two promising candidates (Hf1-N1P2-1 and Tc1-N4), which exhibit not only low overpotentials of 0.56 and 0.49 V but also high thermodynamic and electrochemical stability, as well as good selectivity towards NRR over the competing hydrogen evolution reaction. We also demonstrate the ability of Hf1-N1P2-1 and Tc1-N4 to activate and hydrogenate N2 by donating electrons and regulating charge transfer. This study not only predicts new BP-based promising catalysts but also provides guidance for the rational design of high-performance NRR electrocatalysts under ambient conditions.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="chen2024unusual" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Unusual Sabatier principle on high entropy alloy catalysts for hydrogen evolution reactions</div> <div class="author"> Zhi Wen Chen✝, Jian Li✝, <em>Pengfei Ou</em>, Jianan Erick Huang, Zi Wen, LiXin Chen, Xue Yao, GuangMing Cai, Chun Cheng Yang*, Chandra Veer Singh*, and Qing Jiang* </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Nature Communications</em>, 2024 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-44261-4" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">HTML</a> <a href="/assets/pdf/chen2024unusual.pdf" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">PDF</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>The Sabatier principle is widely explored in heterogeneous catalysis, graphically depicted in volcano plots.

A new descriptor was proposed to design HEA catalysts for HER. As a proof-of-concept, the synthesized PtFeCoNiCu HEA catalyst endows a high catalytic performance for HER with an overpotential of 10.8 mV at −10 mA cm−2 and 4.6 times higher intrinsic activity over the state-of-the-art Pt/C.

Unfortunately, to date, the electrooxidation of propylene under ambient conditions has suffered from a wide product distribution, leading to a low faradic efficiency toward the desired propylene glycol. We undertook mechanistic investigations and found that the reconstruction of Pd to PdO occurs, followed by hydroxide formation under anodic bias. The formation of this metastable hydroxide layer arrests the progressive dissolution of Pd in a locally acidic environment, increases the activity, and steers the reaction pathway toward propylene glycol. Rh-doped Pd further improves propylene glycol selectivity. Density functional theory (DFT) suggests that the Rh dopant lowers the energy associated with the production of the final intermediate in propylene glycol formation and renders the desorption step spontaneous, a concept consistent with experimental studies.

However, due to the anodic competition between the chlorine evolution and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), direct seawater splitting suffers from a low current density and limited operating stability. Exploration of catalysts enabling an OER overpotential below the hypochlorite formation overpotential (≈490 mV) is critical to suppress the chloride evolution and facilitate seawater splitting. Here, a proton-adsorption-promoting strategy to increase the OER rate is reported, resulting in a promoted and more stable neutral seawater splitting. The best catalysts herein are strong-proton-adsorption (SPA) materials such as palladium-doped cobalt oxide (Co3–xPdxO4) catalysts. These achieve an OER overpotential of 370 mV at 10 mA cm−2 in pH-neutral simulated seawater, outperforming Co3O4 by a margin of 70 mV. Co3–xPdxO4 catalysts provide stable catalytic performance for 450 h at 200 mA cm−2 and 20 h at 1 A cm−2 in neutral seawater. Experimental studies and theoretical calculations suggest that the incorporation of SPA cations accelerates the rate-determining water dissociation step in neutral OER pathway, and control studies rule out the provision of additional OER sites as a main factor herein.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="zhao2023conversion" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Conversion of CO2 to multicarbon products in strong acid by controlling the catalyst microenvironment</div> <div class="author"> Yong Zhao✝, Long Hao✝, Adnan Ozden✝, Shijie Liu✝, Rui Kai Miao, <em>Pengfei Ou</em>, Tartela Alkayyali, Shuzhen Zhang, Jing Ning, Yongxiang Liang, Yi Xu, Mengyang Fan, Yuanjun Chen, Jianan Erick Huang, Ke Xie, Jinqiang Zhang, Fengwang O’Brien, Edward H.

In this article, we report an ultrasensitive FET biosensor that integrates a novel format of 2D MoS2, vertically-aligned MoS2 nanolayers (VAMNs), as the channel material for label-free detection of the prostate-specific antigen (PSA). The developed VAMNs-based FET biosensor shows two distinctive advantages. First, the VAMNs can be facilely grown using the conventional chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method, permitting easy fabrication and potential mass device production. Second, the unique advantage of the VAMNs for biosensor development lies in its abundant surface-exposed active edge sites that possess a high binding affinity with thiol-based linkers, which overcomes the challenge of molecule functionalization on the conventional planar MoS2 nanolayers. The high binding affinity between 11-mercaptoundecanoic acid and the VAMNs was demonstrated through experimental surface characterization and theoretical calculations via density functional theory. The FET biosensor allows rapid (within 20 min) and ultrasensitive PSA detection in human serum with simple operations (limit of detection: 800 fg mL−1). This FET biosensor offers excellent features such as ultrahigh sensitivity, ease of fabrication, and short assay time, and thereby possesses significant potential for early-stage diagnosis of life-threatening diseases.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="lee2023supramolecular" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Supramolecular tuning of supported metal phthalocyanine catalysts for hydrogen peroxide electrosynthesis</div> <div class="author"> Byoung-Hoon Lee✝, Heejong Shin✝, Armin Sedighian Rasouli✝, Hitarth Choubisa✝, <em>Pengfei Ou</em>, Roham Dorakhan, Ivan Grigioni, Geonhui Lee, Erfan Shirzadi, Rui Kai Miao, Joshua Wicks, Sungjin Park, Hyeon Seok Lee, Jinqiang Zhang, Yuanjun Chen, Zhu Chen, David Sinton, Taeghwan Hyeon*, Yung-Eun Sung*, and Edward H.

Here we report a catalyst design strategy in which off-target intermediates (such as ethylene and ethanol) in the reduction of CO to acetate are destabilized. On the optimized Ag–CuO2 catalyst, this destabilization of off-target intermediates leads to an acetate Faradaic efficiency of 70% at 200 mA cm−2. We demonstrate 18 hours of stable operation in a membrane electrode assembly; the system produced 5 wt% acetate at 100 mA cm−2 and a full-cell energy efficiency of 25%, a twofold improvement on the highest energy-efficient electrosynthesis in prior reports.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="lee2023selective" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Selective synthesis of butane from carbon monoxide using cascade electrolysis and thermocatalysis at ambient conditions</div> <div class="author"> Mi Gyoung Lee✝, Xiao-Yan Li✝, Adnan Ozden✝, Joshua Wicks✝, <em>Pengfei Ou</em>, Yuhang Li, Roham Dorakhan, Jaekyoung Lee, Hoon Kee Park, Jin Wook Yang, Bin Chen, Jehad Abed, Roberto dos Reis, Geonhui Lee, Jianan Erick Huang, Tao Peng, Ya-Huei(Cathy) Chin, David Sinton, and Edward H.

In a C2H4 dimerization reactor, we directly upgrade the gas outlet stream of the CO2 or CO electrolyser without purification. We find that CO, which is present alongside C2H4, enhances C2H4 dimerization selectivity to give C4H10 to 95%, a much higher performance than when a CO2 electrolyser is used instead.

Herein, we report non-precious Cu-Sn diatomic sites anchored on nitrogen-doped porous carbon (CuSn/NPC) as an efficient catalyst for CO2RR to CO. The catalyst exhibits outstanding selectivity with CO Faradaic efficiency (FE) up to 99.1%, much higher than those of individual Cu (66.2%) and Sn (51.3%) single-atom catalysts. Moreover, high stability is confirmed by consecutive 24 h electrolysis with high selectivity from CO2 to CO. Theoretical calculations reveal an obvious activation of CO2 with weakened C—O bonds and distorted CO2 configuration upon chemisorption on the CuSn/NPC catalyst. It is also suggested CuSn/NPC is more selective for the CO2RR with dominant CO production during the electrolysis, rather than the competing hydrogen evolution reaction.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="chen2023basal" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Basal plane activation of two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides via alloying for the hydrogen evolution reaction: first-principles calculations and machine learning prediction</div> <div class="author"> Yiqing Chen, Ying Zhao, <em>Pengfei Ou*</em>, and Jun Song* </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Journal of Materials Chemistry A</em>, 2023 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2023/ta/d3ta01361h" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">HTML</a> <a href="/assets/pdf/chen2023basal.pdf" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">PDF</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides (2D TMDCs) show promise as potential inexpensive electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). However, their performance is bottlenecked by the inertness of the basal plane. The present study demonstrates alloying as a viable route to address such limitations. A machine learning workflow based on density functional theory (DFT) calculations has been established to predict the HER activity and stability for a series of 2D cation-mixed TMDC alloys of various compositions. The results showed that alloying exhibits a substantial effect in reducing the Gibbs free energy of hydrogen adsorption (ΔGH) on the basal plane, able to render optimal ΔGH for the HER for certain TMDC alloys. The stability prediction of these TMDC alloys further showed their potential to be synthesized in experiments. The mechanism underlying this alloying induced basal plane activation originates from the electronic effect, in particular the p-band shifting, resulting from the chemical composition variation. The findings are expected to serve as guidance for the rational design and discovery of TMDC alloys for catalytic applications.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="cao2023surface" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Surface hydroxide promotes CO2 electrolysis to ethylene in acidic conditions</div> <div class="author"> Yufei Cao✝, Zhu Chen✝, Peihao Li, Adnan Ozden, <em>Pengfei Ou</em>, Weiyan Ni, Jehad Abed, Erfan Shirzadi, Jinqiang Zhang, David Sinton, Jun Ge*, and Edward H.

Acetate is one such C2 compound on the path to the large but fossil-derived acetic acid market. Here we pursued dispersing a low concentration of Cu atoms in a host metal to favour the stabilization of ketenes10—chemical intermediates that are bound in monodentate fashion to the electrocatalyst. We synthesize Cu-in-Ag dilute (about 1 atomic per cent of Cu) alloy materials that we find to be highly selective for acetate electrosynthesis from CO at high *CO coverage, implemented at 10 atm pressure. Operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy indicates in situ-generated Cu clusters consisting of &lt;4 atoms as active sites. We report a 12:1 ratio, an order of magnitude increase compared to the best previous reports, in the selectivity for acetate relative to all other products observed from the carbon monoxide electroreduction reaction. Combining catalyst design and reactor engineering, we achieve a CO-to-acetate Faradaic efficiency of 91% and report a Faradaic efficiency of 85% with an 820-h operating time.

However, conventional alkaline and neutral CO2-to-CH4 systems suffer CO2 loss to carbonates, and recovering the lost CO2 requires input energy exceeding the heating value of the produced CH4. Here we pursue CH4-selective electrocatalysis in acidic conditions via a coordination method, stabilizing free Cu ions by bonding Cu with multidentate donor sites. We find that hexadentate donor sites in ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid enable the chelation of Cu ions, regulating Cu cluster size and forming Cu-N/O single sites that achieve high CH4 selectivity in acidic conditions. We report a CH4 Faradaic efficiency of 71% (at 100 mA cm−2) with &lt;3% loss in total input CO2 that results in an overall energy intensity (254 GJ/tonne CH4), half that of existing electroproduction routes.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="fan2023cationic" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Cationic-group-functionalized electrocatalysts enable stable acidic CO2 electrolysis</div> <div class="author"> Mengyang Fan✝, Jianan Erick Huang✝, Rui Kai Miao✝, Yu Mao✝, Pengfei Ou✝, Feng Li, Xiao-Yan Li, Yufei Cao, Zishuai Zhang, Jinqiang Zhang, Yu Yan, Adnan Ozden, Weiyan Ni, Ying Wang, Yong Zhao, Zhu Chen, Behrooz Khatir, Colin P.

One promising remedy—using a high concentration of alkali cations—steers CO2R towards multi-carbon (C2+) products, but these same alkali cations result in salt formation, limiting operating stability to &lt;15 h. Here we present a copper catalyst functionalized with cationic groups (CG) that enables efficient CO2 activation in a stable manner. By replacing alkali cations with immobilized benzimidazolium CG within ionomer coatings, we achieve over 150 h of stable CO2R in acid. We find the water-management property of CG minimizes proton migration that enables operation at a modest voltage of 3.3 V with mildly alkaline local pH, leading to more energy-efficient CO2R with a C2+ Faradaic efficiency of 80 ± 3%.

We reasoned that replacing the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with anodic electrosynthesis of acetic acid from ethanol at industrial current densities could be a route to increase the economic efficiency of green hydrogen production. We partition the selective oxidation of ethanol to acetic acid into two mechanistically distinct transformations: first ethanol oxidation followed by the production of *OH. Density functional theory (DFT) studies show that the aldehyde-derived intermediate CH3CO* from ethanol oxidation and the *OH radical from water dissociation are both needed in the electroproduction of acetic acid. Operando Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy identifies the corresponding aldehyde intermediates on the anode surface. Based on these mechanistic findings, we develop a vacancy-rich IrRuOx catalyst and achieve selective electrotransformation of ethanol to acetic acid at a generation rate of 30 mmol/cm2/h and a partial current density of 3 A/cm2, fully 10× higher than in the previous highest-activity reports.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="luo2023selective" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Selective electrochemical synthesis of urea from nitrate and CO2 via relay catalysis on hybrid catalysts</div> <div class="author"> Yuting Luo✝, Ke Xie✝, Pengfei Ou✝, Chayse Lavallais✝, Tao Peng, Zhu Chen, Zhiyuan Zhang, Ning Wang, Xiao-Yan Li, Ivan Grigioni, Bilu Liu, David Sinton, Jennifer B.

We report a strategy that increases selectivity to urea using a hybrid catalyst: two classes of site independently stabilize the key intermediates needed in urea formation, *CO2NO2 and *COOHNH2, via a relay catalysis mechanism.

Central to the construction of a rational artificial photosynthesis integrated device is the requirement for a catalyst to break the bottleneck of C–C coupling. Here, based on operando spectroscopy measurements, theoretical calculations and feedstock experiments, it is discovered that gold, in conjunction with iridium, can catalyse the reduction of CO2, achieving C–C coupling by insertion of CO2 into –CH3. Due to a combination of optoelectronic and catalytic properties, the assembly of AuIr with InGaN nanowires on silicon enables the achievement of a C2H6 activity of 58.8 mmol g−1 h−1 with a turnover number of 54,595 over 60 h.

However, pristine TMDCs are bottlenecked by the insufficiency of active sites in the basal plane. In this study, focusing on polycrystalline MoS2, we perform systematic density functional theory calculations to investigate the role of grain boundaries (GBs) on the catalytic performance of MoS2 for CO2RR. Our results show that most GBs contribute to lowering the reaction energy of the potential-limiting step in CO2RR. This effect can be further amplified with the introduction of S vacancies. In addition, the introduction of GBs with vacancies is shown to act as an effective method to break the scaling relations between reaction intermediates, which is crucial in improving catalytic efficiencies.

Single-atom catalysts with maximized metal utilization and altered electronic structure are the most promising alternatives to replace current benchmark precious metals. However, the atomic level understanding of the functional role for each species at the anchoring sites is still unclear and poorly elucidated. Herein, we report Fe single atom catalysts with the sulfur and oxygen functional groups near the atomically dispersed metal centers (Fe1/NSOC) for highly efficient ORR. The Fe1/NSOC delivers a half-wave potential of 0.92 V vs. RHE, which is much better than those of commercial Pt/C (0.88 V), Fe single atoms on N-doped carbon (Fe1/NC, 0.89 V) and most reported nonprecious metal catalysts. The spectroscopic measurements reveal that the presence of sulfur group induces the formation of epoxy groups near the FeN4S2 centers, which not only modulate the electronic structure of Fe single atoms but also participate the catalytic process to improve the kinetics. The density functional theory calculations demonstrate the existence of sulfur and epoxy group engineer the charges of Fe reactive center and facilitate the reductive release of OH* (rate-limiting step), thus boosting the overall oxygen reduction efficiency.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="miao2023electrified" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Electrified Cement Production via Anion-Mediated Electrochemical Calcium Extraction</div> <div class="author"> Rui Kai Miao✝, Ning Wang✝, Sung-Fu Hung, Wen-Yang Huang, Jinqiang Zhang, Yong Zhao, <em>Pengfei Ou</em>, Sasa Wang, Jonathan P Edwards, Cong Tian, Jingrui Han, Yi Xu, Mengyang Fan, Jianan Erick Huang, Yurou Celine Xiao, Alexander H.

On average, producing each kilogram of cement leads to the emission of 1 kg of CO2─the combination of fuel combustion emissions and carbon released from the feedstock, limestone (CaCO3). Here we report electrochemical cement production based on anion-mediated electrochemical calcium extraction (ECE) that addresses both feedstock and energy emissions. The in situ-generated acidic electrolytes release the feedstock CO2 emissions at high purity, enabling direct carbon utilization or sequestration without costly capture and purification steps. Energy embodied within a separate H2 output stream is sufficient to sinter Ca(OH)2 to produce portland cement, thus removing the CO2 emissions associated with fuel combustion. We then replace CaCO3 with a carbon-free calcium feedstock, gypsum, thereby removing the CO2 emissions embodied in the feedstock.

Recently, alloying has been demonstrated as an effective method to control the properties of 2D materials. In this study, the stability, and the electronic and chemical properties of monolayer Ga(1−x)AlxN alloys were investigated employing density functional theory (DFT) calculations and the cluster expansion (CE) method. The results show that 2D Ga(1−x)AlxN alloys are thermodynamically stable and complete miscibility in the alloys can be achieved at ambient temperature (&gt;85 K). By analyzing CE results, the atomic arrangement of 2D Ga(1−x)AlxN was revealed, showing that Ga/Al atoms tend to mix with the Al/Ga atoms in their next nearest site. The band gaps of Ga(1−x)AlxN random alloys can be tuned by varying the chemical composition, and the corresponding bowing parameter was calculated as −0.17 eV. Biaxial tensile strain was also found to change the band gap values of Ga(1−x)AlxN random alloys ascribed to its modifications to the CBM positions. The chemical properties of Ga(1−x)AlxN can also be significantly altered by strain, making them good candidates as photocatalysts for water splitting.

Among products from CO2RR, multicarbon chemicals, such as ethylene and ethanol with high energy density, are more valuable. However, the selectivity and reaction rate of C2 production are unsatisfactory due to the sluggish thermodynamics and kinetics of C–C coupling. The electric field and thermal field have been studied and utilized to promote catalytic reactions, as they can regulate the thermodynamic and kinetic barriers of reactions. Either raising the potential or heating the electrolyte can enhance C–C coupling, but these come at the cost of increasing side reactions, such as the hydrogen evolution reaction. Here, we present a generic strategy to enhance the local electric field and temperature simultaneously and dramatically improve the electric–thermal synergy desired in electrocatalysis. A conformal coating of ∼5 nm of polytetrafluoroethylene significantly improves the catalytic ability of copper nanoneedles (∼7-fold electric field and ∼40 K temperature enhancement at the tips compared with bare copper nanoneedles experimentally), resulting in an improved C2 Faradaic efficiency of over 86% at a partial current density of more than 250 mA cm–2 and a record-high C2 turnover frequency of 11.5 ± 0.3 s–1 Cu site–1. Combined with its low cost and scalability, the electric–thermal strategy for a state-of-the-art catalyst not only offers new insight into improving activity and selectivity of value-added C2 products as we demonstrated but also inspires advances in efficiency and/or selectivity of other valuable electro-/photocatalysis such as hydrogen evolution, nitrogen reduction, and hydrogen peroxide electrosynthesis.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="ou2022electric" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Electric metal contacts to monolayer blue phosphorus: electronic and chemical properties</div> <div class="author"> <em>Pengfei Ou*</em>, Guoqiang Lan, Yiqing Chen, Xiao-Yan Li, Xiao Zhou, Cheng Chen, Fanchao Meng, and Jun Song* </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Applied Surface Science</em>, 2022 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169433222010030" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">HTML</a> <a href="/assets/pdf/ou2022electric.pdf" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">PDF</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>The contact nature when monolayer blue phosphorus (blueP) interfaces with three transition metal electrodes (i.e., Pd, Ir, and Pt) was unraveled by the ab initio density functional theory calculations. Specifically, n-type Schottky contact is observed for Ir(1 1 1)-blueP, in contrast, p-type Schottky contacts are formed for Pd(1 1 1)- and Pt(1 1 1)-blueP. The Fermi level is pinned partially at metal-blueP interfaces due to two interfacial behaviors: one being the modification of metal work function caused by interface dipole formation ascribed to a redistribution of charges, and the other being the production of gap states that are dominated by P p-orbitals since the intralayer Psingle bondP bonds are weakened by the interfacial metal-P interactions. The incorporation of metal substrates would also significantly alter the chemical properties of the adsorbed monolayer blueP. The binding strength of hydrogen can be enhanced by as much as 0.9 eV, which resulted from two parts: one is the charge transfer from metal substrate to monolayer blueP rendering a stronger Hsingle bondP coupling; the other is a strong interfacial interaction after the hydrogen adsorption. The free energy change of H adsorption onto Ir(1 1 1)-blueP is as low as 0.16 eV which is comparable to the most efficient catalyst of Pt.

Here, single-atom catalysts based on 37 monometallic elements are synthesized using a dissolution-and-carbonization method, characterized and analysed to build the largest reported library of single-atom catalysts.

To address the issues, we design a catalyst with diatomic Pd-Cu sites on N-doped carbon by modulation of single-atom Pd sites with Cu. The introduction of Cu not only shifts the partial density of states of Pd toward the Fermi level but also promotes the d-2π* coupling between Pd and adsorbed N2, leading to enhanced chemisorption and activated protonation of N2, and suppressed hydrogen evolution.

Rolled-up nanotechnology, as a batch fabrication strategy for generating three-dimensional (3D) microtubes, has been demonstrated to possess unique advantages for constructing FET biosensors. In this paper, we report a new approach combining the two fascinating technologies, the FET biosensor and the rolled-up microtube, to develop a microfluidic diagnostic biosensor. We integrated an excellent biosensing III-nitride material—indium nitride (InN)—into a rolled-up microtube and used it as the FET channel. The InN possesses strong, intrinsic, and stable electron accumulation ( 1013 cm−2) on its surface, thereby providing a high device sensitivity. Multiple rolled-up InN microtube FET biosensors fabricated on the same substrate were integrated with a microfluidic channel for convenient fluids handling, and shared the same external electrode (inserted into the microchannel outlet) for gating voltage modulation. Using human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibody as a model disease marker, we characterized the analytical performance of the developed biosensor and achieved a limit of detection (LOD) of 2.5 pM for serum samples spiked with HIV gp41 antibodies.

Renewable methane produced using CO2 electroreduction attracts interest due to the established global distribution network; however, present-day efficiencies and activities remain below those required for practical application. Here we exploit the fact that the suppression of *CO dimerization and hydrogen evolution promotes methane selectivity: we reason that the introduction of Au in Cu favors *CO protonation vs. C−C coupling under low *CO coverage and weakens the *H adsorption energy of the surface, leading to a reduction in hydrogen evolution. We construct experimentally a suite of Au-Cu catalysts and control *CO availability by regulating CO2 concentration and reaction rate. This strategy leads to a 1.6× improvement in the methane:H2 selectivity ratio compared to the best prior reports operating above 100 mA cm−2.

The stress-strain responses of graphene honeycombs were found to be dependent on the loading direction, prism size and lattice orientation, but little affected by the junction type. Two critical deformation events, i.e., elastic buckling and structural collapse, were identified, with the associated local and global structural changes associated at these critical events clarified. Continuum models accounting for the effect of lattice orientation and size-dependent yielding have been developed to quantitatively predict the threshold stresses for those critical deformation events. In addition, it has been demonstrated that the overall stress-strain curve of graphene honeycomb can also be reasonably well predicted via continuum modeling, albeit deviation at large strains due to effect of junction on cell wall bending.

It is shown that the spatial average of the wave vector ⟨k⟩ vanishes at a specific temperature as functions of the layer thickness and refractive index. The values of the temperature corresponding to zero-refractive-index (zero-⟨n⟩) are demonstrated to be suppressed when the refractive index or the ratio of the layer width is enhanced.

In particular, the hollow sites, a new group of sites induced by phase boundaries, show great promise by exhibiting a Gibbs free energy (ΔGH) near the thermoneutral value for hydrogen adsorption, comparable to that of Pt. The mechanisms underlying hydrogen adsorption at phase boundaries were then revealed, shown to be attributed to the unique local hydrogen adsorption geometries and electronic structures at phase boundaries.

The Mn–O3N1/PC catalyst yields an NH3 yield rate of 66.41 μg h–1 mgcat.–1 (corresponding to 1.56 mg h–1 mgMn–1) at −0.35 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode, which is about four times that on the control Mn–N4/PC catalyst. The enhanced NRR performance is ascribed to its unique geometry and electronic structures, which not only facilitate the adsorption and activation of the N2 molecule but also lower the free energy change of the potential-determining step.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2019</h2> <ol class="bibliography"> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="ou2019superior" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Superior sensing properties of black phosphorus as gas sensors: a case study on the volatile organic compounds</div> <div class="author"> <em>Pengfei Ou</em>, Pengfei Song, Xinyu Liu, and Jun Song* </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Advanced Theory and Simulations</em>, 2019 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/adts.201800103" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">HTML</a> <a href="/assets/pdf/ou2019superior.pdf" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">PDF</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>The unique structure and prominent properties of black phosphorus (BP) and its monolayer and multilayers in device applications have attracted significant attention to this elemental 2D material. In this study, a comprehensive evaluation of the candidacy of monolayer BP as a channel material for high-performance volatile organic compound (VOC) sensors is conducted combining first-principles density functional theory calculations and non-equilibrium Green’s function formalism. The adsorption configurations and energetics of several typical VOCs (ethanol, propionaldehyde, acetone, toluene, and hexane) on monolayer BP are examined and it is demonstrated that VOCs generally exhibit stronger interaction with monolayer BP than with the widely studied monolayer MoS2, indicative of monolayer BP potentially being a more sensitive VOC sensor. Monolayer BP is shown to exhibit highly anisotropic transport behaviors, whereas the absolute modification of current–voltage responses due to VOCs is found to show a trend that is direction independent. Moreover, the adsorption of VOCs on monolayer BP is strong enough to resist thermal disturbance, yet allows fast recovery time. The results suggest that BP is a compelling and feasible candidate for sensing applications of VOCs.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="guo2019structural" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Structural evolution of oxygen on the surface of TiAlN: Ab initio molecular dynamics simulations</div> <div class="author"> Fangyu Guo, Jianchuan Wang*, Yong Du, David Holec, <em>Pengfei Ou</em>, Hao Zhou, Li Chen, and Yi Kong </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Applied Surface Science</em>, 2019 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169433218332367" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">HTML</a> <a href="/assets/pdf/guo2019structural.pdf" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">PDF</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>We have employed ab initio molecular dynamics simulations to study the oxidation behavior of TiAlN hard coatings as a function of Al content and temperature.

Electrochemical analysis showed that silver catalyzed chalcopyrite dissolution by enhancing the electrochemical reactivity.

As a consequence, the accumulation of passivating species was prevented and the adverse effect of passivation layer mainly consisting of polysulfide and metallic oxides was reduced, thus resulting in high dissolution kinetics.

However, strong Fermi level pinning (FLP) has been observed for contacts between BP and high work function metals, e.g., Cu. Such FLP presents an undesirable hurdle preventing the achievement of high performance field-effect devices. In this regard, there is a crucial need to understand the FLP occurring at the metal–BP interfaces and explore the possibility to reduce it. The present work studied atomic passivation in reducing FLP for the Cu–BP system using density functional theory calculations. The passivation by H, N, F, S, and Cl atoms on the Cu(111) surface has been considered. The results showed that the passivated atoms can shield the direct contact between Cu(111) and BP, thus reducing FLP at Cu–BP interfaces. In particular, S and Cl atoms were found to be highly effective agents to achieve a significant reduction of FLP, leading to Cu–BP contacts with ultralow Schottky barrier height (SBH) and suggesting the possibility of ohmic contact formation. Our findings demonstrate surface passivation as an effective method towards depinning the Fermi level at the metal–BP interface and subsequently controlling the SBH for BP-based electronic devices.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="ou2019single" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Single molybdenum center supported on N-doped black phosphorus as an efficient electrocatalyst for nitrogen fixation</div> <div class="author"> <em>Pengfei Ou</em>, Xiao Zhou, Fanchao Meng, Cheng Chen, Yiqing Chen, and Jun Song* </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Nanoscale</em>, 2019 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2019/nr/c9nr02586c" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">HTML</a> <a href="/assets/pdf/ou2019single.pdf" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">PDF</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Ammonia (NH3) is one of the most significant industrial chemical products due to its wide applications in various fields. However, the production of NH3 from the electrochemical nitrogen (N2) reduction reaction (NRR) under ambient conditions is one of the most important issues that remain challenging for chemists. Herein, the candidacy of a series of molybdenum (Mo)-based single-atom catalysts (SACs) supported on N-doped black phosphorus (BP) as the electrocatalyst for the NRR has been evaluated by means of density functional theory (DFT) calculations. In particular, Mo1N3 has been found to chemically adsorb N2, and it exhibits the highest catalytic activity toward the NRR with an ultralow overpotential of 0.02 V via the associative distal mechanism, indicative of catalyzing the NRR under ambient conditions. Additionally, Mo1N3 shows the fast removal of the produced NH3 with a free energy uphill of only 0.56 eV and good stability of NRR intermediates. Moreover, the Mo-based SACs were demonstrated to be more selective to the NRR over the competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) process. These excellent features render Mo1N3 on BP as a compelling highly efficient and durable catalyst for electrochemical N2 fixation. Our results provide a rational paradigm for catalytic nitrogen fixation by SACs in two-dimensional (2D) materials under ambient conditions.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="chen2019vacancy" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Vacancy-assisted core transformation and mobility modulation of a-type edge dislocations in wurtzite GaN</div> <div class="author"> Cheng Chen, Fanchao Meng, Huicong Chen, <em>Pengfei Ou</em>, Guoqiang Lan, Bing Li, Qiwen Qiu, and Jun Song* </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Journal of Physics D: Applied Physics</em>, 2019 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-6463/ab3f78" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">HTML</a> <a href="/assets/pdf/chen2019vacancy.pdf" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">PDF</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>In this study, core structure dependent dislocation dynamics of a-type edge dislocation in three slip systems (basal, prismatic and pyramidal) of wurtzite GaN have been investigated using classical molecular dynamics simulations.

Monolayer WSe2, with a direct energy gap of   1.65 eV is a nearly ideal light absorber to convert sunlight to hydrogen fuels through solar water splitting. To date, however, the controlled synthesis of monolayer WSe2 on a wafer scale and the realization of overall water splitting on WSe2 have remained elusive. Here, we report the van de Waals epitaxy of crystalline monolayer WSe2 on large area amorphous SiOx substrates. We have demonstrated, for the first time, the multi-functionality of monolayer WSe2 in solar water splitting, including extraordinary capacities for efficient light harvesting, water oxidation, and proton reduction. The absorbed photon conversion efficiency exceeds 12% for a single monolayer WSe2. This work provides a viable strategy for wafer-scale synthesis of multi-functional photocatalysts for the development of efficient, low cost, and scalable solar fuel devices and systems.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="chu2018photoelectrochemical" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Photoelectrochemical CO2 reduction into syngas with the metal/oxide interface</div> <div class="author"> Sheng Chu✝, Pengfei Ou✝, Pegah Ghamari✝, Srinivas Vanka, Baowen Zhou, Ishiang Shih, Jun Song*, and Zetian Mi* </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Journal of the American Chemical Society</em>, 2018 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jacs.8b03067" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">HTML</a> <a href="/assets/pdf/chu2018photoelectrochemical.pdf" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">PDF</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Photoelectrochemical (PEC) reduction of CO2 with H2O not only provides an opportunity for reducing net CO2 emissions but also produces value-added chemical feedstocks and fuels. Syngas, a mixture of CO and H2, is a key feedstock for the production of methanol and other commodity hydrocarbons in industry. However, it is challenging to achieve efficient and stable PEC CO2 reduction into syngas with controlled composition owing to the difficulties associated with the chemical inertness of CO2 and complex reaction network of CO2 conversion. Herein, by employing a metal/oxide interface to spontaneously activate CO2 molecule and stabilize the key reaction intermediates, we report a benchmarking solar-to-syngas efficiency of 0.87% and a high turnover number of 24 800, as well as a desirable high stability of 10 h. Moreover, the CO/H2 ratios in the composition can be tuned in a wide range between 4:1 and 1:6 with a total unity Faradaic efficiency. On the basis of experimental measurements and theoretical calculations, we present that the metal/oxide interface provides multifunctional catalytic sites with complementary chemical properties for CO2 activation and conversion, leading to a unique pathway that is inaccessible with the individual components. The present approach opens new opportunities to rationally develop high-performance PEC systems for selective CO2 reduction into valuable carbon-based chemicals and fuels.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="song2018rolled" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Rolled-up SiOx/SiNx microtubes with an enhanced quality factor for sensitive solvent sensing</div> <div class="author"> Pengfei Song, Cheng Chen, Juntian Qu, <em>Pengfei Ou</em>, MHT Dastjerdi, Zetian Mi, Jun Song, and Xinyu Liu* </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Nanotechnology</em>, 2018 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-6528/aad0b1" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">HTML</a> <a href="/assets/pdf/song2018rolled.pdf" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">PDF</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>The microtubes made through rolling-up of strain-engineered nanomembranes have received growing research attention after their first invention due to the technology’s high flexibility, integrability, and versatility. These rolled-up microtubes have been used for a variety of device applications including sensors, batteries and transistors, among others. This paper reports the development of highly sensitive whispering-gallery mode (WGM) chemical sensors based on rolled-up microtube optical microcavities (RUM-OCs). For the first time, such microcavities were batch fabricated through rolling-up of plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD)-synthesized SiOx/SiNx bilayer nanomembranes, which have better optical properties than the conventional electron-beam-deposited SiO/SiO2 bilayers. Benefiting from the high refractive index (RI) of PECVD-deposited SiNx, our RUM-OC shows an enhanced quality factor of 880 that is much higher than that (50) of a SiO/SiO2 RUM-OC with the same dimensions. The developed RUM-OC is used for sensitive WGM solvent sensing, and demonstrate a limit of detection of 10−4 refractive index unit (RIU), which is 10 times lower than that (10−3 RIU) of a SiO/SiO2 RUM-OC.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="chen2018effect" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Effect of topological patterning on self-rolling of nanomembranes</div> <div class="author"> Cheng Chen, Pengfei Song, Fanchao Meng, <em>Pengfei Ou</em>, Xinyu Liu, and Jun Song* </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Nanotechnology</em>, 2018 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-6528/aac8fe" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">HTML</a> <a href="/assets/pdf/chen2018effect.pdf" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">PDF</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>The effects of topological patterning (i.e., grating and rectangular patterns) on the self-rolling behaviors of heteroepitaxial strained nanomembranes have been systematically studied.

The adsorption energy was predicted to increase with the number of aromatic rings in the adsorbates, and linearly correlate with the hydrophobicity of PAHs. Additionally, the analysis of the electronic properties showed that PAHs behave as mild n-dopants and introduce electrons into graphene; but do not remarkably modify the band gap of graphene, indicating that the interaction between PAHs and graphene is physisorption. We have also discovered highly sensitive strain dependence on the adsorption strength of PAHs onto graphene surface. The AIMD simulation indicated that a sensitive and fast adsorption process of PAHs can be achieved by choosing graphene as the adsorbent. These findings are anticipated to shed light on the future development of graphene-based materials with potential applications in the capture and removal of persistent aromatic pollutants.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="chen2018predictive" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Predictive modeling of misfit dislocation induced strain relaxation effect on self-rolling of strain-engineered nanomembranes</div> <div class="author"> Cheng Chen*, Pengfei Song, Fanchao Meng, <em>Pengfei Ou</em>, Xinyu Liu, and Jun Song* </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Applied Physics Letters</em>, 2018 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apl/article/113/11/112104/35772/Predictive-modeling-of-misfit-dislocation-induced" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">HTML</a> <a href="/assets/pdf/chen2018predictive.pdf" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">PDF</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Combining atomistic simulations and continuum modeling, the effects of misfit dislocations on strain relaxation and subsequently self-rolling of strain-engineered nanomembranes have been investigated. Two representative material systems including (GaN/In0.5Ga0.5N) of wurtzite lattice and II–VI materials (CdTe/CdTe0.5S0.5) of zinc-blend lattice were considered. The atomistic characteristics of dislocation and the resulting lattice distorting were first determined by generalized-stacking-fault energy profile and disregistry function obtained through Peierls-Nabarro model. Those properties were then used to calculate the accurate mismatch strain of those nanomembranes with the presence of dislocations, and as inputs into von-Karman shell theory to quantitatively evaluate the effects on self-rolling curvature and anisotropy. The theoretical results were further confirmed by atomistic simulations of different crystal geometries and dislocation configurations.

The realization of those possibilities necessitates techniques to enable flexible and controllable phase engineering of MoS2. In the present study, based on first-principles calculations, a new and flexible route to engineer the phase stability of MoS2 by interfacing it with a GaN or AlN substrate is reported. Depending on the surface termination of the underlying substrate, MoS2 may exhibit either the 2H or 1T′ (1T′′) phase. The interface coupling between MoS2 and the substrate also affects the phase transition kinetics. In addition, electron doping can act as another means to influence MoS2–substrate interactions and enable further phase engineering of MoS2. The present findings contribute to new knowledge towards phase engineering of MoS2 and the design of hybrid nanodevices comprising both 2D and 3D optoelectronic materials.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li></ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2015</h2> <ol class="bibliography"> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="ou2015first" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">A first-principles study of structure, elasticity and thermal decomposition of Ti1-xTMxN alloys (TM = Y, Zr, Nb, Hf, and Ta)</div> <div class="author"> <em>Pengfei Ou</em>, Jiong Wang*, Shunli Shang, Li Chen, Yong Du, Zi-Kui Liu, and Feng Zheng </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Surface and Coatings Technology</em>, 2015 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0257897215000481" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">HTML</a> <a href="/assets/pdf/ou2015first.pdf" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">PDF</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>A systematic investigation concerning the effects of transition metals (TM = Y, Zr, Nb, Hf, and Ta) on the structure, elasticity and thermal decomposition of the TiN-based nitride coatings with a cubic rock-salt structure has been performed in terms of first-principles calculations. Calculated lattice parameters of Ti1-xTMxN as a function of alloying concentration show positive derivations from the linearized Vegard’s law, agreeing well with experimental and theoretical results. Positive enthalpies of mixing of Ti1-xTMxN (TM = Y, Zr, and Hf) indicate that the formation of these alloys is energetically unfavored with respect to the mixing of the cubic phases. The predicted consolute temperature of Ti1 − xZrxN agrees reasonably well with previous theoretical findings. The miscibility gaps disappear in the case of alloying TiN with NbN and TaN. Predicted elastic stiffness constants C11, C12, and C44 together with the aggregate polycrystalline properties of Ti1-xTMxN are determined by an efficient strain-stress method.

Based on the experimental measurements and first-principles calculations from the present work and the literature, the Co–Hf system was assessed by means of CALPHAD (CALculation of PHAse Diagram) approach. The excess Gibbs energy of solution phases was modeled with Redlich–Kister polynomial. Sublattice models were employed to describe the homogeneity ranges of Co2Hf, CoHf and CoHf2. The order-disorder transition between B2 (CoHf) and A2 (βHf) phases was taken into account in the current optimization.
