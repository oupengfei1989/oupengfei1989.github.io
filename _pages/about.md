Welcome to the AI4Catalysis Group. I am an incoming Assistant Professor in the Department of Chemistry at the National University of Singapore under NUS Presentidential Young Professorship.

Our research interests focus on
<p>(1) <b><ins>Catalyst design for electrochemical reactions</ins></b> (reaction mechanism, transition states, and reaction thermodynamics and kinetics) using ab initio DFT calculations, cluster expansion, and microkinetic modeling.</p>
<p>(2) <b><ins>Dynamic simulations of chemical processes under reaction conditions</ins></b> (applied potential, field/solvation effect) using (ab initio) molecular dynamics simulations and grand canonical DFT.</p>
<p>(3) <b><ins>Methods development for accelerated catalyst discovery</ins></b> (active learning and Bayesian optimization) using AI/ML, open databases, and data science.</p>

Please see the Research Section for more information about our research interests. Please also see my faculty information at the [NUS Chemistry departmental website](https://chemistry.nus.edu.sg/people/ou-pengfei/). If you have any questions or inquiries, please feel free to contact me via [email](pengfei.ou@northwestern.edu).
